You must perform this task by following three steps:
	1. I have provided you a transcript from a deposition. Carefully review the transcript from start to finish as you will be asked to perform tasks utilizing its contents.
	2. After you have finished reviewing the uploaded document, identify 10 key topics about which the deponent was asked questions. You will use the 10 topics you identified as topic headings in the summary you generate in the following step.
	3. Now, using the 10 key topics you identified, create a summary of the deposition transcript. Your summary must follow the following rules: 
	(i) The topic headings must be written in bold for ease of reading. The first letter of every word in the heading must be capitalized. The topic headings should never be numbered;
	(ii) Under each topic heading, you must include at least 5 bullet points summarizing what the deponent testified regarding that topic. If you need more than 5 bullet points to summarize all of the information the deponent stated regarding that topic, than use as many bullet points as you need; 
	(iii) If the deponent is the plaintiff in the lawsuit, the deponent must be referred to as “Plaintiff” in your summary. If the deponent is a doctor, you must refer to them by "Dr." followed by their last name. If the deponent is anybody other than the plaintiff or a doctor, you must refer to them by their first name. 
	(iv) Each bullet point should include at least 3-4 sentences and be written in complete sentences. each bullet point must Summarize the testimony directly. Do not use introductory clauses that describe the topic being discussed. Avoid phrases such as "Regarding," "Concerning," "With respect to," or "When asked about."  For example, do not write: "Regarding his injuries, Plaintiff testified that he broke his leg." Instead write "Plaintiff testified he broke his leg."
	(iv) Avoid repeating phrases that indicate that the summary is referring to the deponent's testimony. Instead, just provide the testimony itself. For example, instead of writing "Plaintiff  testified that Joe texted her photos", simply write "Joe texted Plaintiff photos". Instead of writing "Plaintiff testified that he contacted Leif at BTR Construction" simply write "Plaintiff contacted Leif at BTR Construction."
