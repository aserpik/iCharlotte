Your task is to generate a "PROCEDURAL HISTORY" section for a legal status report based on the information and documents I will provide to you or that are available in our current conversation context.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The generated section *must strictly adhere to the style, tone, format, structure, and level of detail* demonstrated in the examples provided below. You are essentially mimicking the writing style and conventions used in those examples.

Here are the specific requirements:

1.  **Title:** Do NOT include the title "**PROCEDURAL HISTORY**" in your response. Start directly with the first sub-section.
2.  **Structure:** The section should be divided into sub-sections using capital letters followed by a period (A., B., C., etc.). The sub-section titles should be concise and descriptive, similar to the examples (e.g., Pleadings, Venue, Representation, Future Hearings, Government Tort Claim, Responsive Pleading, etc.).
3.  **Standard Sub-sections:** Based on the examples, the section should typically include, *if* the relevant information is available in the provided context, the following sub-sections in a logical order:
    *   Pleadings (or Complaint, or Government Tort Claim if that's the initial step)
    *   Venue
    *   Representation (referring to Plaintiff's Counsel)
    *   Future Hearings (or Upcoming Hearings)
    *   Include other relevant procedural steps as demonstrated in the examples (e.g., Responsive Pleading, Cross-Complaints, Amended Complaints, Government Tort Claim details and rejection) if information is provided about them.
4.  **Content per Sub-section:**
    *   **Pleadings/Complaint:** State when the matter was initiated (filing of original complaint), by whom, against whom, and briefly list the causes of action. Include details and dates of subsequent relevant pleadings like Answers, Amended Complaints, or Cross-Complaints filed by any party mentioned in the source material, noting which parties filed them. Mention the filing of responsive pleadings on behalf of the client the report is for, including the date and mention of asserting applicable affirmative defenses.
    *   **Government Tort Claim (if applicable):** If information about a pre-litigation tort claim is provided, include details like the submission date, a brief summary of the claims/allegations/injuries as stated in the claim, and the date it was accepted or rejected.
    *   **Venue:** State the court, county, and possibly department/judge where the case is venued. State whether venue is proper and concisely explain why (e.g., location of incident). If information is provided about the jury pool characteristics (like "largely conservative"), include that detail.
    *   **Representation:** Identify Plaintiff's counsel by name and firm. Include location of the firm and/or a brief description of their practice area or reputation if that information is provided. You can include any brief, factual commentary on counsel *if* it's in the source material (e.g., "cooperative," "experienced").
    *   **Future/Upcoming Hearings:** List scheduled future court dates or deadlines (Case Management Conference, Settlement Conference, Trial Setting Conference, Trial, etc.). Include the type of hearing and the date. *Crucially*, include a sentence at the end of this sub-section confirming the date(s) are calendared and attendance is planned *to protect the client's interests* (you should be able to identify the client from the overall context or provided information). Use phrasing similar to the examples, e.g., "We confirm that we have calendared this date and will appear at the same to protect [Client's Name/Interest] interests."
5.  **Tone and Style:**
    *   Maintain a formal, factual, objective, concise, and legalistic tone, reporting only on procedural events.
    *   Write from the perspective of representing the client for whom the report is being prepared.
    *   Use clear, direct sentences.
    *   Use standard legal terminology as seen in the examples (e.g., "filed their Complaint," "asserting three causes of action," "timely filed an Answer," "venue is proper").
    *   Do not include analysis, arguments, or subjective opinions beyond what is demonstrated in the examples (e.g., commentary on jury pool or counsel's demeanor *if provided*).
6.  **Information Usage:** Only include information that is explicitly present or clearly inferable from the documents/context you are given. Do not invent dates, facts, or procedural steps.
7.  **Handling Missing Information:** If information for a typical sub-section (like Future Hearings) is not available in the provided context, omit that specific sub-section. Only include sub-sections for which you have relevant information to report, while prioritizing the standard ones listed above.
