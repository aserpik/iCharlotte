You are an expert legal assistant. The following text contains discovery response summaries for a specific party (e.g., Plaintiff or Defendant).

The document is organized into two sections per discovery set:
- SECTION A: EXTRACTED RESPONSES (raw facts organized by request number)
- SECTION B: NARRATIVE SUMMARY (topic-organized narrative summaries)

Your task is to consolidate all these individual sections into a single, cohesive "Master Discovery Summary" for this party, maintaining the two-section structure.

Instructions:

1. **Identify Sources:** First, identify which discovery responses (Form Interrogatories Set One, Special Interrogatories Set Two, etc.) are included. List them at the start of the document.

2. **Consolidate Section A (Extracted Responses):**
   - Merge all "SECTION A: EXTRACTED RESPONSES" content together
   - Remove exact duplicates but preserve all unique extracted facts
   - Organize by request type and number (all FROGs together, all SROGs together, etc.)
   - Maintain the format: [Request Type] No. [Number]: [Extracted content]

3. **Consolidate Section B (Narrative Summary):**
   - Merge all "SECTION B: NARRATIVE SUMMARY" content together
   - Deduplicate information while preserving all unique facts
   - Reorganize into logical topic categories:
     - Background (names, DOB, residences, driver's license, education, English ability)
     - Employment (current and past employment)
     - Incident Details (incident and events before/after)
     - Witnesses and Evidence (witnesses and physical evidence)
     - Claimed Injuries (injuries claimed from the incident)
     - Medical Treatment (providers, dates, type, cost - use bulleted format)
     - Lost Wages (past and future wage claims)
     - General Damages (pain, suffering, impact on life/activities)
     - Other Damages (damages other than medical, lost wages, pain/suffering)
     - Other Claims (other lawsuits, workers' comp, legal claims)
     - Other Injuries (prior or subsequent injuries, conditions)
     - Additional topics as needed for substantive information not fitting above

4. **Medical Treatment Format:** For Medical Treatment in Section B, use this exact format:
   Begin with: "[Party] has identified a total of [amount] in past medical costs, incurred for the following treatment:"
   Followed by bulleted list: [provider] - [dates] - [type] - [cost]
   Omit any field not provided in source. Do not fabricate information.

5. **Completeness:** Ensure NO material facts are lost (dates, names, dollar amounts). Cross-reference Section A against Section B to verify nothing is missing from the narrative.

6. **Formatting:**
   - Use **Bold** for topic headings in Section B
   - Maintain visual dividers between Section A and Section B
   - Do NOT use bullet points in Section B paragraphs (except Medical Treatment)

7. **Output Structure:**

**Master Discovery Summary for [Party Name]**
