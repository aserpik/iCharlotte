Computing Time in State Court Litigation Checklist (CA)by Practical Law LitigationMaintained • California A Checklist that provides California litigators with key steps for computing time periods measured in days for state court litigation. This Checklist outlines how to identify the correct time period and triggering event, distinguish between court days and calendar days, and calculate both forward-counting and backward-counting deadlines. It explains how to apply automatic extensions of time under the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Rules of Court, including crucial service-based extensions for documents served by US mail, express mail, fax, or electronic transmission. The Checklist also addresses how these service extensions apply to motions, including the specific notice periods for most motions and for summary judgment motions. Finally, it details the rules for extending deadlines that fall on a weekend or holiday, helping practitioners accurately determine the final due date for any filing or required act.    Step 1: Determine General Size of Time Period Step 2: Identify Triggering Event and Deadline Direction Step 3: Count Days in Time Period Step 4: Account for Service-Based Extensions Step 5: Account for Weekend and Holiday Extensions Step 1: Determine General Size of Time Period Number of days. Check the statute or rule governing the specific task at issue to determine the time period in which the task must be completed (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1005(b) (motion papers must be served and filed at least 16 court days before hearing date)).Court or calendar days. Determine whether the time period is computed in:calendar days (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.260(a) (interrogatory responses to be served within 30 days after service of interrogatories)); orcourt days, meaning days the court is open for business (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1005(b) (motion papers must be served and filed at least 16 court days before hearing date)).Default timeframe. If the statute or rule does not specify the timeframe in court days, the measurement is in calendar days (In re R.R., 187 Cal. App. 4th 1264, 1276 (2010); Iverson v. Super. Ct., 167 Cal. App. 3d 544, 548 (1985)). Step 2: Identify Triggering Event and Deadline Direction Triggering event. Determine the event that triggers the running of the time period (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.260(a) (service of interrogatories triggers deadline in which to serve interrogatory responses)).Deadline direction. Determine whether the deadline is:forward-counting, meaning the deadline is computed by counting the number of days after the event that triggers the running of the time period (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.260(a) (forward-counting deadline to serve interrogatory responses)); orbackward-counting, meaning the deadline is computed by counting the number of days before the triggering event (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12c; for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1005(b) (backward-counting deadline for service and filing of initial moving papers)). Step 3: Count Days in Time Period Exclude first day. Begin counting on the day immediately:after the triggering event, for forward-counting deadlines (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(a)); andbefore the triggering event, for backward-counting deadlines (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12c(a)).Include intermediate days. For time periods counted in:calendar days, include every intermediate day in the time period, even weekends and intervening holidays; andcourt days, include only days the court is open (do not include intervening weekends and holidays).Include last day. Include the last day of the period unless that day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(a)).Weekend and holidays. If a deadline lands on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the deadline is extended to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday (see Step 5: Account for Weekend and Holiday Extensions). Step 4: Account for Service-Based Extensions Non-motions. For non-motion deadlines tied to service of a document, add:five, ten, 12, or 20 calendar days to the deadline (depending on where the place of mailing and place of receipt are located), if serving by US mail (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1013(a)); ortwo court days to the deadline if serving by Express mail or overnight courier (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1013(c)), fax (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1013(e)), or electronic transmission such as email (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1010.6(a)(3)(B)).Motions. Extend the 16-court-day notice period (applicable to most motions, with some exceptions) between the hearing date and the date the initial moving papers must be served and filed by:five, ten, 12, or 20 calendar days (depending on where the place of mailing and place of receipt are located), if serving the initial motion papers by US mail (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1005(b); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 437c(a)(2) (applying rule to 81-day notice period for summary judgment motions));two calendar days if serving the initial motion papers by Express mail, overnight courier, or fax (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1005(b); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 437c(a)(2) (two court days added to 81-day notice period for summary judgment motions); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.306(d) (two court days added for fax service); see Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-B, 9:87.2 (recognizing conflict between Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Section 1005(b) and Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.306(d))); ortwo court days if serving the initial motion papers by electronic means such as email (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1010.6(a)(3)(B)).Exceptions. California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1013’s extensions do not affect the time to file a notice of intention to move for new trial, notice of intention to move to vacate judgment under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 663a, or a notice of appeal (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 1013(a), (c), (e), and 1010.6(a)(3)(B)). Step 5: Account for Weekend and Holiday Extensions Basic rule. If a deadline falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday, the time period continues to run (forward or backward, as the case may be) to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 10, 12, 12a(a), and 12b; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12c (applying rule to backward-counting deadlines); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(a), (b)).Holidays defined. For purposes of computing time, holidays include:Saturdays (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 12a(a));Sundays (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 10);judicial holidays designated in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 135 (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 10 and 12a(a));closures due to emergency conditions (Cal. Gov’t Code § 68115(a)(4); see also, for example, LA Superior Court News Release (March 16, 2020) (declaring court statutory holiday to toll time and deadlines due to the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)); anddays in which the court (other than a branch office) is closed for the entire day (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 12a(a) and 12b).Weekend holidays. A judicial holiday that falls on:a Saturday is observed on the preceding Friday; anda Sunday is observed on the following Monday.(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.11.)Judicial Council. The Judicial Council’s website lists the days when California courts are closed in observance of judicial holidays.

Extending Time in State Court Litigation (CA)by Practical Law LitigationMaintained • California A Practice Note outlining the key issues for counsel to consider when seeking to extend a deadline in an unlimited civil action in California state court. This Practice Note examines the standards and procedures for obtaining both prospective extensions before a deadline expires and retroactive relief after a deadline has passed. It details the different avenues for securing more time, including by stipulation with opposing counsel. This Practice Note also explains the distinct legal grounds for each type of request, from showing “good cause” for a prospective extension to demonstrating “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473. Additionally, it addresses the court’s authority and its limits, identifying certain deadlines that cannot be extended and explaining the procedural requirements for mandatory and discretionary relief.    Basic Principles Key Rules Deadlines That May Be Extended Limits on Court’s Power Prospective Deadline Extensions Grounds for Obtaining an Extension Moving for an Extension Stipulating to an Extension Best Practices for Seeking a Prospective Deadline Extension Retroactive Deadline Extensions Grounds for Obtaining a Retroactive Extension Application for a Retroactive ExtensionIf a party needs more time to file a document or take other action in a lawsuit, generally the superior court may, in its discretion, grant deadline extensions before the original time period expires. In certain circumstances, counsel may stipulate to prospective deadline extensions without requesting the court’s permission. In other circumstances, counsel may be able to obtain relief from the court after the time to act has expired if counsel can show that there was mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect. This Note outlines the key issues to consider when requesting common deadline extensions from the court or opposing counsel. For a discussion on the computation of time periods in California litigation, see Practice Note, Computing Time in State Court Litigation (CA).  Basic Principles If a party needs a deadline extension, California courts have discretion to extend certain timeframes set by the California Rules of Court and the California Code of Civil Procedure (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(c) and 2.20; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a)). California courts may grant both prospective and retroactive requests for extensions of time. However, the procedure for seeking an extension of time and the standard under which the courts analyze the request differ depending on whether a party makes the request before or after the deadline has expired. Prospective relief is much easier to obtain, and counsel should request a deadline extension as soon as they determine that they need one. Key Rules Before requesting an extension, counsel should review the applicable statutes and rules, including: Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054 (extension of time).Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(a) (enlargement of time to answer or demurrer).Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(b) (relief from judgment, dismissal, or order taken against the party based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect).Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10 (extension of time by the court and computation of time).Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20 (application for order extending time).Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(d) (parties may stipulate to one 15-day extension to respond to the initial complaint).Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(e) (modification of deadline for service of complaint or cross-complaint and response to initial complaint).Cal. Gov’t Code § 68115 (court’s ability to extend deadlines and take other actions due to public emergencies).Cal. Gov’t Code § 68616 (minimum time periods for certain actions, extension of time for service of pleadings, responsive pleadings, and provisions for certain stipulations extending time).Statutes specific to a particular procedure may have requirements in addition to or different from the generally applicable rules. For example, the Discovery Act authorizes relief from some discovery deadlines (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2024.060). Counsel should also consult the superior court’s local rules as well as the judge’s individual rules before seeking an extension of time in a specific matter. For example: In Los Angeles Superior Court, the rules encourage counsel to grant deadline extensions to alleviate the burden of asking the court’s permission (CA R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 3.26 and CA R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Appendix 3.A(a)).In San Francisco Superior Court, there are special requirements for seeking extensions of deadlines to serve the summons and complaint and respond to the complaint (CA R SAN FRANCISCO SUPER CT Rule 3.1).Deadlines That May Be Extended California courts have the discretion to extend deadlines in certain situations (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(c) and 2.20). Unless provided otherwise by orders in a specific case, a party may obtain an extension of time for any of the following: Responding to or serving pleadings (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(e); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a)).Law and motion matters (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1103(b); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a) (any act related to a service of notice)).Any act to be performed by a party under the California Rules of Court (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 1.10(c); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20 (any act that “is required by law”)).Limits on Court’s Power A court’s discretion to extend deadlines has limits. There are several key litigation acts for which extensions are unavailable even if a party requests the extension before the time to act expires. A party may not obtain an extension of time for any of the following: Serving a notice of appeal. The time within which a party may file a notice of appeal is fixed by law. It cannot be enlarged by stipulation of the parties or by court order. (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a); Maynard v. Brandon, 36 Cal. 4th 364, 372 (2005); Land v. Johnston, 156 Cal. 253, 255 (1909).)Serving a notice of motion for a new trial (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 659(b) and 1054(a); see also Maynard, 36 Cal. 4th at 372).Other acts for which specific statutory provisions prohibit certain extensions (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a) (extensions allowed “unless otherwise expressly provided”)).Even where a court can grant an extension, the duration of the extension may be limited. For example, for matters related to pleadings, preparation of bills of exceptions, and certain notices, a court may not grant an extension beyond 30 days without the consent of opposing counsel (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a)).  Prospective Deadline Extensions Seeking a deadline extension before the original time period has expired is the easiest way to obtain an extension. A party may secure a prospective deadline extension from the court or, in some cases, by stipulation with opposing counsel. Grounds for Obtaining an Extension When a party makes a request to extend certain deadlines before the original time period expires, the court may grant the extension: For good cause.With or without notice and consent.(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20 and 3.110(e).) Although extensions commonly require a showing of good cause, courts liberally apply the standard for good cause (see Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 9(I)-F, 9:361 (”good cause” liberally construed for ex parte extension request)). Moving for an Extension Parties usually request deadline extensions by ex parte application, but, on occasion, need to make a noticed motion to obtain an extension. Ex Parte ApplicationBefore a deadline expires, a party may apply ex parte to extend a deadline by 30 days on a showing of good cause. This includes deadlines related to pleadings, bills of exceptions, or certain notices. The extension of time is not limited to pleading matters and can include law and motion matters. (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1103(b); Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(a) (any act related to a service of notice).) California’s definition of ex parte is more expansive than in federal court and some other state jurisdictions. In California, ex parte proceedings usually require that the adverse party be given minimal notice and an opportunity to respond. The moving party typically needs to give notice to all parties in the action by 10:00 a.m. on the court day before the moving party goes to court (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1203(a)). Attorneys commonly give notice by calling or emailing opposing counsel. The moving party also must serve the ex parte application at the first reasonable opportunity (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1206). In exceptional circumstances, ex parte proceedings may be conducted without notice to and outside the presence of others impacted by the proceedings (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1203(a)). An ex parte application for an extension of time must: Be heard and determined by the judge before whom the matter is pending unless that judge has died or is otherwise unavailable (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(a)).Disclose in writing the nature of the case and what extensions, if any, the parties have obtained by court order or stipulation of counsel (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(b)).Comply with the requirements of ex parte applications specified in California Rules of Court, rule 3.1200 to 3.1207 and any individual rules of the superior court or judge pertaining to ex parte applications. Specifically, an ex parte application requires submission of:an application stating the relief requested;a declaration stating the factual showing required;a declaration based on personal knowledge stating the notice given;a memorandum of points and authorities; anda proposed order.(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1201.)Counsel must serve any order extending time within 24 hours after the making of the order or within any time the court orders (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(c)). For more information on ex parte applications, see Practice Note, Motion Practice: Ex Parte Applications (CA). For a sample ex parte application, see Standard Document, Ex Parte Application (CA). On NoticeIf time permits (or the rules require it), a party may also request a deadline extension by a noticed motion. In some cases, a noticed motion is required to extend a deadline. For example, a party must make a noticed motion to extend the time to respond to any of the following: Interrogatories (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.260(a)).Requests for production of documents and other tangible objects (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2031.260(a)).Requests for admission (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2033.250(a)).The court does not grant this relief on an ex parte basis. The rules provide that the court may grant ex parte relief to a party seeking to limit the number of parties to be served with interrogatories (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.260(c)). However, the discovery statutes do not explicitly provide for ex parte relief with the extension of other deadlines, so the assumption is that the motion must be noticed. The noticed motion for a deadline extension should: Be heard and determined by the judge before whom the matter is pending unless that judge has died or is otherwise unavailable (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(a)).Disclose in writing the nature of the case and what extensions, if any, the parties have obtained by court order or stipulation of counsel (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(b)).Follow the requirements of a noticed motion under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1005 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110 to 3.1116 and Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300 to 3.1312 (general motion requirements, explanation of motion, and required documents for motion)). Specifically, a noticed motion requires:the motion itself;a notice of hearing on the motion; anda memorandum in support of the motion.(Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1112(a).)Depending on the type of motion and the court’s and judge’s rules, counsel may need to file certain additional documents with the court. These additional documents may include, for example, declarations, affidavits, exhibits, requests for judicial notice, and proposed orders. For more information on how to draft motion papers, see Practice Note, Motion Practice: Drafting the Motion Papers (CA). If there is not enough time to hear a noticed motion, counsel may file an ex parte application to hear the motion on an expedited basis (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1200 to 3.1207). Counsel must serve any order extending time within 24 hours after the making of the order or within any time the court orders (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 2.20(c)). Stipulating to an Extension Parties may stipulate to extend certain deadlines, although some stipulations require filing or court approval (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(d)). In some cases, the courts encourage parties to stipulate to alleviate the burden of asking permission of the court (for example, CA R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Rule 3.26 and CA R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Appendix 3.A(a)). In Los Angeles Superior Court, the court rules recommend that counsel grant as a matter of courtesy the first request for a reasonable extension of time to respond to litigation deadlines “relating to pleadings, discovery or motions,” unless time is of the essence (CA R LOS ANGELES SUPER CT Appendix 3.A(a)). Attorneys who think they cannot meet a deadline should ask opposing counsel to voluntarily agree to extend the deadline before the expiration of the original time period (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054(b); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(d)). Counsel should check the statutory and case law and the court rules regarding the particular case to ensure that counsel meet all the requirements when seeking a deadline extension by stipulation. Stipulations Between the PartiesThe parties may stipulate to extend the deadlines without court involvement for any of the following:  Acts related to the pleadings, preparation of bills of exception, or to the service of certain notices (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054).A responsive pleading, provided that the extension is for no more than 15 days beyond the 30-day time period after the plaintiff serves the complaint (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.110(d); Cal. Gov’t Code § 68616(b)).Responding to:interrogatories (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.270);requests for documents or tangible items (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2031.270); orrequests for admission (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2033.260).Filing a motion to compel further discovery responses (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c), and 2033.290(c)). Counsel should be careful to obtain an agreement to extend time because a court likely cannot grant similar relief (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 2030.300(c), 2031.310(c), and 2033.290(c) (noting that a right to a motion to compel is waived unless agreement is reached with the opposing party)).Although a stipulation to extend a deadline must be in writing, attorneys commonly memorialize the agreement in a letter or email to opposing counsel when they do not need to file the stipulation. This is especially true for stipulations related to discovery (for example, Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 2030.270(b) (agreement may be informal, but in writing)). Filed StipulationsWhen agreeing to certain extensions, the parties must file their stipulation. In some situations, stipulations must be approved by the court. This typically occurs when a local rule or judge’s rule requires filing or approval or when the parties seek to alter a court-ordered deadline. For example, the parties must file the stipulation (but need not obtain court approval) if, within 30 days of service of the responsive pleadings, the parties stipulate to a single continuance of a proceeding for no more than 30 days (Cal. Gov’t Code § 68616(d)). If there is any doubt about whether a given situation requires filing, counsel should contact the court. Best Practices for Seeking a Prospective Deadline Extension Counsel should do the following to maximize the client’s chances of receiving a deadline extension: Request an extension before the time period expires, if possible.Show diligence by seeking the extension as soon as they recognize the need for it.Consult the court’s local rules where the action is pending and the presiding judge’s rules, if any.Consider whether the parties may stipulate to extend time periods without an order from the court.Seek a stipulation to extend time with court approval or an agreement not to oppose a request to extend time.Be aware of limits on the court’s power to extend a time period. Retroactive Deadline Extensions Counsel should try to avoid requesting an extension of time after the original time period has expired because the options for counsel are much more limited after expiration of a deadline. In general, the court may not grant an extension after expiration of a statutory deadline (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 1054 (statute does not specify that an extension may be sought after the time has expired unlike the similar federal rule, Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b)); Coast Elec. Serv. v. Jensen, 111 Cal. App. 124, 127 (1931) (”the court loses jurisdiction to extend time upon the expiration of the statutory period within which the act may have been done”); Freese v. Freese, 134 Cal. 48, 50 (1901) (time to act had expired and thus judge had no authority to extend time)). In limited circumstances, counsel may apply under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473 to extend a deadline after time has expired (Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(a)(1); Cornell Univ. Med. Coll. v. Super. Ct., 38 Cal. App. 3d 311, 315-16 (1974)). Grounds for Obtaining a Retroactive Extension Even if a party makes the required showing, the court generally has discretion whether to grant a retroactive extension. In limited circumstances, however, the court must grant an extension retroactively. Mandatory Retroactive ExtensionsThe court must grant a retroactive extension when an attorney: Attempts to set aside a default or a dismissal that has the effect of a default.Shows by affidavit or declaration that the default or dismissal was the attorney’s fault. Specifically, the affidavit or declaration must show the attorney’s:mistake;inadvertence;surprise; orneglect (any neglect, it does not have to be “excusable”).(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(b); see Practice Note, Default Judgment: Vacating the Judgment (CA): Mandatory Motion to Vacate for Attorney Mistake.) In addition to all the usual motion requirements (see Application For A Retroactive Extension) this type of motion must state that the attorney seeks mandatory relief under Section 473(b) (Luri v. Greenwald, 107 Cal. App. 4th 1119, 1125 (2003)). Mandatory relief under Section 473(b) of the Code of Civil Procedure includes defaults entered by the trial court, even though the statute specifies defaults entered by the clerk (Lorenz v. Commercial Acceptance Ins. Co., 40 Cal. App. 4th 981, 998-99 (1995) (mandatory relief granted but noting many cases where mandatory relief denied); Urban Wildlands Group, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 10 Cal. App. 5th 993, 998-1001 (2017) (mandatory relief under Section 473(b) based on an attorney’s affidavit of fault does not apply unless there has been an actual default, default judgment, or dismissal)). Discretionary ExtensionsThe court may grant a retroactive extension in situations that are neither eligible for mandatory relief nor covered by a subject-specific statute. A court has discretion to grant a party relief from a “judgment, dismissal, order or other proceeding” taken against the party if the court determines: That it would be just to provide relief.One of the following circumstances exist:mistake;inadvertence,surprise; orexcusable neglect.(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(b).) Unlike a mandatory extension, a discretionary extension is not limited to a default or dismissal. A “proceeding,” as used in Section 473(b), incorporates “[a]ll the steps or measures adopted in the prosecution or defense of an action.” (Maynard, 36 Cal. 4th at 372.) Counsel need not be at fault for a discretionary extension. The error may be anyone’s. However, any neglect must be excusable. Ordinary neglect is insufficient. For example, courts awarded discretionary retroactive extensions in the following types of cases: Untimely filing of cost bills (Soda v. Marriott, 130 Cal. App. 589, 592-94 (1933) (mistake and inadvertence excused when attorney wholly unfamiliar with case filed cost bills 24 days late after lead attorney was appointed to the bench)).Filing petition for writ of mandate after time for filing lapsed (Cornell Univ. Med. Coll., 38 Cal. App. 3d at 314-15 (permitting extension of time where statutory deadline was not jurisdictional and messenger inadvertently delivered writ to federal appellate court)).Even if a party makes the required showing, the court lacks discretion to grant relief if another statute specifically governs a particular proceeding. For example, where the Discovery Act expressly authorizes relief for some types of discovery-related proceedings, a court lacks the authority to grant relief under Section 473(b) (Zellerino v. Brown, 235 Cal. App. 3d 1097, 1104-07, 1109 (1991) (granting discretionary relief from issuance of untimely early demand for expert witness disclosure but noting that other discovery related proceedings are governed by the Discovery Act)). Application for a Retroactive Extension Counsel seeking a deadline extension under Section 473(b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure after the time has expired must: Follow the requirements of a noticed motion under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1005 (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1110 to 3.1116; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1300 to 3.1312; see also On Notice). At least one court has held that a party must apply for relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 473(b) by noticed motion (Arambula v. Union Carbide Corp., 128 Cal. App. 4th 333, 341-42, 345-46 (2005)).Include evidence of one of the following:mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect in the form of an “attorney affidavit of fault” (when seeking mandatory relief); ormistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect in the form of a declaration (when seeking discretionary relief).Include a copy of the proposed answer, additional pleading, or other papers.Seek the relief:within a reasonable time, but in no case later than six months, after the judgment, dismissal, order, or proceeding at issue occurs, if applying for discretionary relief; orno more than six months after entry of judgment, if applying for a mandatory extension. Entry of judgment may occur after the default or dismissal giving rise to the motion.(Cal. Civ. Proc. Code § 473(b).)

Law and Motion[9:1] STRATEGY CONSIDERATIONS RE LAW AND MOTION PRACTICE:(1) The threshold considerations are TIME and MONEY: Time, because there is often so little of it when preparing your papers and arguing the case in court; and because there is frequently so little time on crowded court calendars that you may not be able to schedule the motion when you want or need to have it heard. And money, because it may be extremely costly for your client to win a motion, and even more costly to lose one. In many cases, it simply may not be worth the effort (unless, perhaps, you can find some way to make your opponent pay your attorney fees and costs (see ¶ 9:463 ff.)).(2) The other major consideration is your litigation objectives: Will winning this motion significantly advance your client’s interest? Winning some motions may cause your opponents to reevaluate their case and lead to an early settlement. However, other motions may have no impact on the probable outcome at trial. Therefore, they simply may not be worth the time and money required. Discuss with your client the costs involved, the chances of success, and the litigation objective. If losing the motion would have a negative impact on the case, this should also be discussed with the client.(3) Thus, the bottom line is often a costs vs. benefits analysis: Will obtaining the relief sought by the motion advance the client’s case sufficiently to outweigh the costs and risks of making the motion?(4) Try “meeting and conferring”: Consider whether the result sought may be obtained by some other, less expensive means—e.g., telephoning opposing counsel and proposing a stipulation as to the matter in question. The less crucial the motion, the more likely you can obtain such stipulation, and save the client the costs and risks of a motion. (A “meet and confer” is required on demurrers, motions to strike, and many discovery motions. See CCP §§ 430.41, 435.5, 2023.010(i); and ¶ 7:97.15 ff., 7:189.1 ff., 8:1158 ff.)(5) Caution re sanctions• CCP § 128.5 permits a trial court to order a party or a party’s attorney to pay any reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, “incurred by another party as a result of actions or tactics, made in bad faith, that are frivolous or solely intended to cause unnecessary delay” (see ¶ 9:1010 ff.);• CCP § 128.7 authorizes sanctions for violation of the certificate of factual and legal merit created by an attorney’s presenting any pleading or paper to the court (see ¶ 9:1135 ff.).© 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[9:13.10] Civility Guidelines1. [9:2] “Motion” Defined: A motion is simply a request that a court make an order. [CCP § 1003—“An application for an order is a motion”]a. [9:2.1] Formal vs. informal motions: Motions during trial generally may be made orally. But in pretrial practice, motions must be made according to the procedures discussed below (¶ 9:3 ff.). Informal requests to the court (e.g., a letter to the judge asking to postpone a hearing) are improper and ineffective. If time does not permit filing the necessary papers, counsel’s remedy is to seek an order shortening time for making the motion (see ¶ 9:364).(1) [9:2.2] Notice requirements: Some statutes specifically require notice to the opposing party; others do not. But even where a statute is silent as to notice, due process of law requires adequate notice and opportunity to be heard on any motion that affects the rights of the opposing party. See discussion at ¶ 9:349 ff.(2) [9:2.3] “Label” not determinative: A trial court may disregard a motion’s label (title) and construe it as a different type of motion. This is consistent with the court’s inherent authority to manage and control its docket. [Austin v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (2016) 244 CA4th 918, 930, 198 CR3d 239, 249—post-judgment motion “for reconsideration” treated as motion for relief under CCP § 473(b); see Sorenson v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2013) 219 CA4th 409, 421, 161 CR3d 794, 804, fn. 13—“request for reconsideration” treated as new motion because it did not seek modification, amendment or revocation of order resulting from earlier motion; see also ¶ 7:158.2][9:2.4] Reserved.b. [9:2.5] When motion “made”: A motion is complete and is “deemed to have been made” upon filing and service of the notice of motion. [CCP § 1005.5]Therefore, even though the notice of motion may specify that it will be made (i.e., heard) on a specific date in the future, it is actually “made” upon filing and service of the requisite papers. [Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 CA4th Supp. 10, 13, 76 CR2d 171, 173] 2. [9:3] Rules Governing Motions: Motions frequently require consideration of both the substantive law on which the motion is based, and the procedural rules for making the motion. The procedural rules may be found in any or all of the following sources:a. [9:4] Statutes: The California Code of Civil Procedure contains several statutes authorizing, or requiring, various kinds of motions at various stages of the proceeding. Examples: Motions to quash service of summons (CCP § 418.10); demurrers (CCP § 430.10); motions for summary judgment (CCP § 437c).In addition, the CCP contains numerous provisions governing when, how and where motions before trial shall be made.Examples:• The time for noticing motions (CCP § 1005, ¶ 9:31);• When a motion is deemed made (CCP § 1005.5);• The form of a motion (CCP § 1010);• The method of service of a motion (CCP §§ 1010.6-1015, 1017, 1020);• Powers of judges and commissioners to hear motions (CCP §§ 166, 259).b. [9:5] Case law: Although most of California’s procedural rules have been codified, there are still a few motions based on judicial precedent rather than statute. Examples: motion for equitable relief from judgment after time for relief under CCP § 473 has expired (¶ 5:435 ff.); motion to dismiss as substitute for general demurrer (¶ 7:370 ff.); and nonstatutory motion for judgment on the pleadings (¶ 7:277).c. [9:6] California Rules of Court: The Judicial Council is authorized to “adopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure, … not inconsistent with statute.” [Cal.Const. Art. VI, § 6(d)]The Judicial Council has adopted Rules of Court (CRC) governing law and motion matters in superior courts and official forms to be used on certain types of motions and proceedings. These Rules and Judicial Council forms are available on the California Courts website (www.courts.ca.gov). Many of the Judicial Council forms can be filled out online, saved and printed.The CRC governing law and motion practice generally—e.g., format and filing of papers, notice, hearings, etc.—are discussed in this Chapter. Other CRC rules relating to specific motions and procedures—discovery, summary judgment, injunctions, etc.—are discussed in other Chapters of this Practice Guide.(1) [9:6.1] Effect as law: The California Rules of Court have the force and effect of law, so long as not inconsistent with statute. [In re Jermaine B. (1994) 21 CA4th 1280, 1284, 26 CR2d 612, 615; In re Alonzo J. (2014) 58 C4th 924, 937, 169 CR3d 661, 670—“a [CRC] rule is inconsistent with a statute if it conflicts with either the statute’s express language or its underlying legislative intent”]A CRC rule may go beyond the provisions of a related statute so long as it reasonably furthers the statutory purpose. [See Mann v. Cracchiolo (1985) 38 C3d 18, 29, 210 CR 762, 767 (overruled on other grounds by Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 C5th 536, 543, 213 CR3d 764, 768)—rule limiting time to file opposition to summary judgment motion]But a CRC rule may not change statutory requirements. [People v. Hall (1994) 8 C4th 950, 960, 35 CR2d 432, 438; California Court Reporters Ass’n, Inc. v. Judicial Council of Calif. (1995) 39 CA4th 15, 33-34, 46 CR2d 44, 56 (invalidating former Rule of Court that allowed electronic recording of superior court proceedings because CCP § 269 requires official shorthand record); Carlton v. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. (2014) 228 CA4th 1200, 1210, 175 CR3d 909, 916 (construing CRC 3.1320(j) in manner consistent with statute (CCP § 471.5) because “statute takes precedence over the rule of court”)]d. [9:7] Local court rules: Courts are authorized to adopt local rules to expedite court operations. Such rules are valid so long they are consistent with higher authority—i.e., statutes or case law, or the statewide rules adopted by the Judicial Council. [CCP § 575.1; see Gov.C. § 68070; Marriage of Woolsey (2013) 220 CA4th 881, 900, 163 CR3d 551, 564-565—local rule “cannot impose requirements for enforcement of mediated settlement agreements in addition to those specified by statute”]Local rules must be adopted in accordance with procedures set forth in CCP § 575.1 (e.g., proposed rules submitted to the public, including local bar associations and others, for consideration and recommendation, then approved by majority of court’s judges, plus publication and filing procedures). [See Hall v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2005) 133 CA4th 908, 915, 35 CR3d 206, 210]Local court rules are published by local legal newspapers and are generally available on each court’s website. They can also be accessed through the California courts website (www.courts.ca.gov).(1) [9:7.1] Limitation—certain local rules preempted (CRC 3.20(a)): Local rules relating to most pretrial proceedings, including pleadings and motions, are preempted by the CRC. [CRC 3.20(a); see discussion at ¶ 9:13.2 ff.](2) [9:8] Content: Valid local court rules typically cover such matters as the time and days of the week law and motion matters are heard or the department or courtroom in which such matters are heard. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.5; S.F. Sup.Ct. Rules 6.11, 8.1-8.2, 8.10, 9.0]Such rules, however, cannot impose deadlines different from those specified in statutes or the CRC. [CRC 3.20(a)](3) [9:9] Effect as law: Local courts have inherent power to prescribe rules of practice and procedure before such courts. Therefore, so long as those rules are not contrary to higher authority (i.e., statutes, case law or the California Rules of Court), they have the force and effect of law. [Gov.C. § 68070; see Mann v. Cracchiolo (1985) 38 C3d 18, 29, 210 CR 762, 767 (overruled on other grounds by Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 C5th 536, 543, 213 CR3d 764, 768)](4) [9:9a] Interpretation: The policies and rules of the trial court are for it to construe and apply. Except where this impairs due process, an appellate court is bound by the trial court’s construction of its own rules. [Villacampa v. Russell (1986) 178 CA3d 906, 911, 224 CR 73, 76](5) [9:9.1] Enforcement: Violation or disregard of valid local rules (i.e., those not inconsistent with higher authority) is ground by itself for denial of a motion. [See Wisniewski v. Clary (1975) 46 CA3d 499, 504, 120 CR 176, 180](a) [9:9.1a] Sanctions: In addition, if the local rules so provide, the court on motion may:• Strike all or any part of the pleadings of the party violating the rules; or• Dismiss the action or enter judgment by default against such party; or• Impose other penalties of a lesser nature as otherwise provided by law; and• Order that party or party’s counsel to pay to the moving party reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, incurred in seeking enforcement of the rules. [CCP § 575.2(a)](b) [9:9.2] Limitation—innocent client protected: Any penalty for failing to comply with a local rule that is counsel’s responsibility must be imposed on the lawyer, not the client. [CCP § 575.2(b); Garcia v. McCutchen (1997) 16 C4th 469, 475, 66 CR2d 319, 323]This is different from the general rule that an attorney’s neglect is imputed to the client. [See Shipley v. Sugita (1996) 50 CA4th 320, 325, 57 CR2d 750, 752]It is the court’s duty to invoke this limitation on client liability on its own motion. [Garcia v. McCutchen, supra, 16 C4th at 475, 66 CR2d at 323; see Cooks v. Sup.Ct. (Cruz) (1990) 224 CA3d 723, 727, 274 CR 113, 116—error to deny client’s demand for jury trial because of counsel’s violation of local rule]e. [9:10] Local court policies: In addition to formal rules, courts may promulgate written “policies” regulating practice and procedure.Any policy concerning practice or procedure in that court or by a judge is treated as a local rule (see CRC 10.613(a)(2)) and must be adopted and published with certain formalities (i.e., see CRC 10.613(c)); and ordinarily, it may not take effect until January 1 or July 1 at least 45 days after its filing (Gov.C. § 68071). [See Lokeijak v. City of Irvine (1998) 65 CA4th 341, 342, 76 CR2d 429, 430, fn. 1—“a rule by any other name is still a rule”; Hall v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2005) 133 CA4th 908, 915, 35 CR3d 206, 209-210—“30-day motion cut-off rule” (requiring motions to be filed and heard at least 30 days before trial) was “functional equivalent” of local rule and invalid because not adopted in accordance with CCP § 575.1 procedures]Like local rules, court policies that relate to most pretrial proceedings are preempted by CRC 3.20(a) (see ¶ 9:13.2 ff.).f. [9:11] General orders: Local courts also may issue “general orders.” For example, a number of courts issued general orders, implementing emergency powers the Chief Justice delegated to the courts in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as requiring face coverings and social distancing.g. [9:12] “Local, local” rules: In addition to local court rules (and policies), individual judges may adopt rules applicable to proceedings in their particular courtrooms. (These are often referred to as “local, local” rules.) However, such rules must now be adopted with the same formalities as local court rules (see ¶ 9:10). [CCP § 575.1(c); CRC 10.613; Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp. (1996) 49 CA4th 1152, 1158-1160, 57 CR2d 200, 204-205—local courtroom rule invalid because not adopted in accordance with required formalities; see Hall v. Sup.Ct. (People), supra, 133 CA4th at 917, 35 CR3d at 212, fn. 18]These “local, local” rules are also subject to the preemption provisions of CRC 3.20(a) (see ¶ 9:13.2 ff.).(1) [9:12.1] Comment: Because of the formalities now required, far fewer “local, local” rules are likely to be adopted in the future, and those not published as local court rules will be unenforceable (see ¶ 9:10). However, counsel should recognize that individual judges will still have preferred methods for the presentation of materials and argument to the court.➪ [9:13] PRACTICE POINTER: Familiarize yourself not only with the court rules but also with local policies in every court in which you practice. Judges hearing law and motion estimate that at least 25% of the cases on their calendars are tentatively denied simply for failure to comply with some applicable rule.As an officer of the court, it is your “professional responsibility to be aware of and knowledgeable about duly adopted local rules.” [Annex British Cars, Inc. v. Parker-Rhodes (1988) 198 CA3d 788, 791, 244 CR 48, 50 (emphasis added)]Also familiarize yourself with the judge’s personal preferences and idiosyncrasies. You can do this by talking to the courtroom staff (when court is not in session), talking to other lawyers who have appeared before the judge, observing the judge while court is in session, and reviewing published judicial profiles (Judge’s Handbook and Daily Journal “Judicial Profile” series), and verdict reports.Other valuable sources of information are articles (i.e., law reviews, news, the Daily Journal) about or authored by the judge. You also may want to read appellate opinions affirming or reversing the judge, as well as any appellate opinions written by the judge if the judge has sat pro tem with the court of appeal. In addition, judges are required to file Form 700 Reports on a yearly basis listing gifts and sources of other income; these reports can be reviewed on the Fair Political Practices Commission website (www.fppc.ca.gov).h. [9:13.1] Local rules, policies invalid where contra to higher authority: Local rules and policies are invalid to the extent they conflict with the CRC, statutes, the Constitution or case law. [Gov.C. § 68070(a); see Elkins v. Sup.Ct. (Elkins) (2007) 41 C4th 1337, 1351-1352, 63 CR3d 483, 490-491—“local courts may not create their own rules of evidence and procedure in conflict with statewide statutes”]For example:• [9:13.1a] A local rule requiring parties to file a joint statement of disputed and undisputed facts on a summary judgment motion violated CCP § 437c, which requires the parties to file separate statements. [Kalivas v. Barry Controls Corp. (1996) 49 CA4th 1152, 1158, 57 CR2d 200, 204]• [9:13.1b] A local rule authorizing summary judgment in favor of the party opposing the motion even if that party made no cross-motion violated statutory requirements for summary judgment. [Sierra Craft, Inc. v. Magnum Enterprises, Inc. (1998) 64 CA4th 1252, 1255, 75 CR2d 681, 683]• [9:13.1c] A local rule providing for expedited summary judgment procedures in asbestos cases impermissibly conflicted with the statute governing summary judgment motions (CCP § 437c). [Boyle v. CertainTeed Corp. (2006) 137 CA4th 645, 649, 40 CR3d 501, 504]• [9:13.1d] A local rule provided 60 days from issuance of the remittitur to file a peremptory challenge to a judge assigned to rehear a case following remand from the court of appeal. The rule was void to the extent it conflicted with CCP § 170.6(a)(2), which requires a successful appellant to make the motion within 60 days of being notified of the assignment. [Ghaffarpour v. Sup.Ct. (Commerce Plaza Hotel) (2012) 202 CA4th 1463, 1470-1471, 136 CR3d 544, 549-550; see ¶ 9:141.5 ff.]• [9:13.1e] The Presiding Judge of the Juvenile Court issued a blanket order declaring the press could not be excluded from juvenile court hearings unless an objection was made and harm to the child was shown. This order was invalid because it conflicted with Welf. & Inst.C. § 346 and CRC 5.530, which gave the court broad discretion to determine who could be present on a case-by-case basis. [In re A.L. (2014) 224 CA4th 354, 364, 168 CR3d 589, 596](1) [9:13.2] Certain local rules preempted by Judicial Council: Local rules concerning the following fields are null and void because preempted by the Judicial Council:— pretrial motions;— demurrers;— discovery;— pleadings;— ex parte applications;— provisional remedies; and— “form and format of papers.” [CRC 3.20(a)](a) [9:13.3] What constitutes local rule: “Local rule” means “every rule, regulation, order, policy, form, or standard of general application adopted by a court to govern practice or procedure in that court or by a judge of the court to govern practice or procedure in that judge’s courtroom.” [CRC 10.613(a)(2); see Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Adams) (2001) 94 CA4th 695, 704, 114 CR2d 541, 547—local rules apply to all members of a class, kind or order](b) [9:13.4] “All” local rules preempted? CRC 3.20(a) says “all local rules” concerning the above matters (¶ 9:13.2) are “null and void.” But this may not apply literally. [See Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Adams), supra, 94 CA4th at 704, 114 CR2d at 547-548]• [9:13.4a] Certain types of local rules concerning motions are expressly authorized; e.g., CRC 3.1308 authorizes local rules governing tentative rulings (see ¶ 9:111 ff.).• [9:13.4b] Others are impliedly authorized. For example, CRC 3.400 governing complex litigation (see ¶ 12:47 ff.) is designed to facilitate the efficient and timely resolution of such cases. To accomplish this result, it impliedly authorizes local courts “to take whatever exceptional management actions are necessary,” including local rules and orders. [Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Adams), supra, 94 CA4th at 704-705, 114 CR2d at 548—no preemption of “general order” in complex asbestos litigation allowing a “master complaint and answer” that parties could incorporate by reference to avoid duplicative pleadings](c) [9:13.5] Compare—rules expressly not preempted: The following local rules are expressly not preempted by CRC 3.20:— those adopted under delay reduction rules (see ¶ 12:48);— those governing trial and post-trial proceedings including motions in limine;— eminent domain proceedings;— injunction proceedings under CCP §§ 527.6-527.8 (involving harassment, group violence and workplace violence); and— proceedings under the Family Code, Probate Code, Welfare and Institutions Code, and Penal Code and all other criminal proceedings. [CRC 3.20(b)][9:13.6 - 9:13.9] Reserved. 3. [9:13.10] Civility Guidelines:• Before filing a motion, attorneys should engage in “more than a pro forma effort” to resolve the dispute or limit the issues informally. To satisfy “meet and confer” requirements (e.g., on discovery motions, see ¶ 8:1158), an attorney is not required to speak personally with opposing counsel, although that is by far the most effective approach (see ¶ 8:1158.1);• An attorney who has no reasonable objection to a proposed motion should promptly make this position known to opposing counsel. An attorney should not force an opponent to file a motion and then not oppose it;• If an attorney files an opposition but then realizes that the moving party’s position is correct, the attorney should promptly advise the movant and the court accordingly;• Monetary sanctions should not be sought unless fully justified by the circumstances and necessary to protect a client’s legitimate interests; and then only after a good faith effort to resolve the issue informally with opposing counsel. [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 10]• A lack of civility can be costly. [Snoeck v. ExakTime Innovations, Inc. (2023) 96 CA5th 908, 932, 314 CR3d 569, 590 (40% reduction in fee award due to incivility)] © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt.

[9:100.6] Clerk’s duty to accept filing➪ [9:14] PRACTICE POINTERS: Saving time is a vital consideration for law and motion practitioners. Before filing any motion, ask yourself, “Is this motion really necessary?” Try to find an alternative way to obtain the relief you seek without the time and expense of a formal motion. Often, the simplest way is to obtain a stipulation from opposing counsel—who, if your motion is well-taken, would be well-advised to agree, to save time and money for the client.Therefore, as a first step before filing any motion (short of dismissal or summary judgment which you know will be opposed), try a telephone request to opposing counsel for a stipulation to the relief you seek. If you’re told to “make your motion,” then see that it is done right the first time, so as to save the maximum amount of time and money for all concerned.Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:• [9:15] Timing “traps”: Make certain you allocate sufficient time in your office routine to actually prepare the motion.Make sure you notice your motion for hearing on a date the court hears law and motion matters (in some courts, you must also reserve the date in advance, see ¶ 9:34); and that the date chosen allows for service and filing in compliance with applicable statutes and court rules. [See CCP § 1005, discussed at ¶ 9:31 ff.]Also, be sure not to file your motion before or after the time permitted by statute or court rules for the particular motion. [E.g., CCP § 437c(a)—60-day “hold” on filing summary judgment motions at outset of litigation, and bar on setting such motions for hearing within 30 days of trial, ¶ 10:56, 10:71; and CCP § 2024.020(a)—15-day “cut-off” on hearing discovery motions prior to trial, ¶ 8:445]• [9:15a] Motions filed prematurely protected? For most purposes, a motion is deemed “made” and pending as of the date the notice of motion is served and filed except where this would “deprive a party of a hearing of the motion to which he is otherwise entitled.” [CCP § 1005.5; see ¶ 9:2.5]At least one court has interpreted this to protect motions served and filed prematurely (while a statutory “hold” is in effect); i.e., such motion will be deemed “made” orally in court at the time of hearing. [Sadlier v. Sup.Ct. (Schoenburg) (1986) 184 CA3d 1050, 1053-1054, 229 CR 374, 376 (motion for summary judgment filed within statutory “hold” period); see ¶ 10:58]Comment: The result is debatable: CCP § 1005.5 may protect a hearing to which a party is “otherwise entitled,” but a party noticing a motion during a statutory “hold” period is arguably not entitled to a hearing.• [9:15.1] File your proof of service: If possible, always file your proof of service along with the motion papers, or immediately thereafter. CRC 3.1300(c) requires that a proof of service of the moving papers be filed with the court no later than 5 court days before the date set for the hearing.CRC 3.1300(c) is mandatory (“must be filed”). Failure to comply may result in the court ordering your motion off calendar without even looking at your papers. Most law and motion judges will not consider a motion that the court file shows was never properly served. See further discussion at ¶ 9:100 ff.• [9:16] Unnecessary appearances: If law and motion calendars are published in local legal newspapers or on the Internet, check to see that your case is set for hearing. Some courts have electronic dockets that can be checked online to see if your papers are shown as filed. If there is any question whether opposing or reply papers have been received and filed, call the court clerk. Telephone opposing counsel the day before the hearing (“Do you intend to appear?”). If there are tentative rulings, be sure to check the tentative ruling, which many judges now post on the Internet. [See Medix Ambulance Service, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Collado) (2002) 97 CA4th 109, 112, 118 CR2d 249, 251]If your motion is unopposed and marked for tentative approval, you may wish to submit it without appearing (but be sure to call the clerk before the hearing; otherwise the matter may be placed off calendar). Or, you may find that for some reason it is not on the calendar; or that opposing counsel has some emergency that necessitates a continuance. In either event, you can save yourself a wasted trip to the courthouse.Many courts require counsel to give prior notice of intent to argue orally, often with fixed time deadlines for doing so. For example, some courts make tentative rulings available by telephone or on the Internet by 3:00 p.m. on the day before the scheduled hearing. These courts may require that a party wishing to argue orally notify the court and opposing counsel by 4:00 p.m. if they intend to appear and argue. A party’s failure to comply with the court’s tentative ruling procedure usually results in loss of the right to argue the motion (see ¶ 9:111 ff.).[9:16.1 - 9:16.4] Reserved.➪ [9:16.5] PRACTICE POINTER: Where the court requires notice to the court and opposing counsel that you intend to appear for a scheduled hearing, be sure to confirm your call with a fax or email and bring a copy with you to court. If you receive no call from opposing counsel and do not intend to appear, confirm the absence of your opponent’s call with a fax or email promptly after the deadline for the telephonic notice.• [9:17] Arriving late: Judges handling law and motion generally call the calendar promptly at the opening of court. All lawyers should have checked in and read the tentative ruling before the calendar call. If you’re going to be late, call the clerk (most judges will hold the matter for a short while, until counsel’s arrival). Those arriving late may find themselves at the foot of the calendar, wasting precious time; or the matter may have been decided adversely, or taken off calendar.Some courts have local rules requiring punctuality. [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(l)(1)]• [9:18] Failing to research the judge: No two judges handle their law and motion calendars the same way. Judges have their own ways of dealing with continuances, late papers and violation of local rules. Some judges require courtesy copies. Find out all you can about the judge before whom you are going to appear (see ¶ 9:13). Consider attending a law and motion session to watch the judge in action. 1. Rules Governing Form and Content of Motion Papersa. [9:19] CRC Rules: The Judicial Council Rules assure uniformity throughout the state on the following matters:(1) [9:20] Form of papers presented for filing: Precise rules govern the form of papers, including the following:For papers not filed electronically:— font size must be at least 12 point type with typeface essentially equivalent to Courier, Times New Roman or Arial;— papers must be printed or typewritten by photocopying or duplication that produces clear and permanent copies as legible as printing;— minimum paper weight (20-pound);— size of paper (8 1/2 x 11 inches);— only one side of each page may be used;— hole punching at top;— page numbering (consecutively at bottom);— first page layout (see ¶ 6:21 ff.); and— footer. [CRC 2.102-2.111]Papers filed electronically must meet the requirements of CRC 2.256(b). [CRC 2.100]Compare—court forms: These rules do not apply to Judicial Council forms or local court forms. [CRC 2.119](a) [9:20.1] Local rules preempted: Any local rules relating to the above matters (¶ 9:20) are clearly preempted by CRC 3.20(a); see ¶ 9:13.2 ff.(b) [9:20.2] Additional rules applicable to Judicial Council forms: Additional rules apply where a Judicial Council form (e.g., summons) is included in the moving papers:• [9:20.3] If a multi-page form is used, it may be filed on pages printed on one side only (even if the original form was printed on both sides); or it may be printed on a “tumbled” two-part sheet (printed head to foot). [CRC 2.134](2) [9:21] Essential data beneath case number: The first page of each paper must specify immediately below the number of the case:— The date, time and place of the scheduled hearing;— The name of the hearing judge if ascertainable;— The nature or title of any attached document other than an exhibit;— The date of filing of the action; and— The trial date, if set. [CRC 3.1110(b)](3) [9:22] Line numbering and spacing: Lines on each page shall be numbered consecutively and shall be either double-spaced or with 1 1/2 spaces between lines. [See CRC 2.108]➪ [9:22a] PRACTICE POINTER: Double-spacing is recommended because it is easier to read. Page limits on memoranda (see ¶ 9:64.10) may tempt you to use the denser, 1 1/2 line spacing, but this will be harder for the judge to read. Therefore, stick with double-spacing. If necessary, edit your arguments to fit within the page limits or seek leave to file a longer memorandum. See further discussion at ¶ 9:64.13.(a) [9:22.1] Exceptions: Single-spacing is permitted in:— descriptions of real property; and— footnotes and quotations (from cases, statutes or other materials). [See CRC 2.108]Also, where corporate surety bonds are filed (e.g., on preliminary injunctions), they may be single-spaced and the lines need not be numbered. (But the first page format requirements (¶ 9:21) still apply.) [See CRC 2.108](4) [9:22.2] Footers: Except for exhibits, each paper filed with the court must bear a “footer”: The bottom of each page must display the page number, then a printed line, then the title of the document (“clear and concise” abbreviations permitted) in at least 10-point type. [CRC 2.110](5) [9:23] Consecutive numbering: Documents bound together must be consecutively paginated. [CRC 2.109, 3.1110(c)]The nature or title of any attached document other than an exhibit must be listed on the cover page (first page). [CRC 3.1110(b)]To the extent practicable, all supporting declarations and memoranda “must be attached” to the notice of motion. [CRC 3.1113(j)]➪ [9:23a] PRACTICE POINTER: It can be helpful to the judge to put your notice of motion, declarations, memorandum of points and authorities and proof of service under one cover and bind them together to avoid their getting separated or misfiled. List the attached papers in your notice of motion. However, if you do so, the pages must be numbered serially throughout the package—rather than beginning anew with each of the documents. [CRC 2.109, 3.1110(c)]The everything-bound-together format may not work, however, for lengthy motions (e.g., motions for summary judgment with numerous separate declarations and lengthy points and authorities). Although all such documents should be filed at the same time, many judges prefer to have each document filed and paginated separately.(6) [9:23.1] References to earlier-filed documents: Any paper previously filed shall be referred to by date of execution (not filing date) and title. [CRC 3.1110(d)]Example: “The following points and authorities are submitted in opposition to the ‘Demurrer of Defendant Smith’ executed March 15, (year).”Parties may incorporate by reference exhibits from prior motions, but it is “prudent” to provide courtesy copies to the judge. [Roth v. Plikaytis (2017) 15 CA5th 283, 292, 222 CR3d 850, 857-858]➪ [9:23.1a] PRACTICE POINTER: It is a good idea to include the filing date because this makes it easier for the judge to find the document in the court file.Where the court file consists of several file folders or is electronically stored, include a copy of the previously filed document as an exhibit to your current filing (or “lodge” a copy with the court; see ¶ 9:24.2). This will save the judge the time required to locate the earlier filed document in the court file. [Roth v. Plikaytis, supra, 15 CA5th at 291, 222 CR3d at 857, fn. 8 (citing text)](7) [9:23.2] Points and authorities: Special rules govern the format of points and authorities. [CRC 3.1113; see ¶ 9:64 ff.](8) [9:23.3] Binding: All pages of each document and each exhibit shall be attached together at the top by a method that permits pages to be easily turned and the entire content of each page to be read (e.g., Acco fasteners). [CRC 3.1110(e)]➪ [9:23.4] PRACTICE POINTER: Documents bound together should be separately tabbed to help the judge find each document easily. Otherwise, you make the judge go through a fat stack of stapled exhibits to locate the document to which you are referring. For courtesy copies, a stack over about 2 inches high is unwieldy.(9) [9:23.5] Exhibits: Each paper exhibit (as distinct from those filed electronically, see ¶ 9:23.10) must be separated from preceding papers by “a hard 8-1/2 x 11 sheet with hard paper or plastic tabs extending below the bottom of the page, bearing the exhibit designation.” [CRC 3.1110(f)(3)](a) [9:23.6] Index required: An “index” to exhibits must be provided. The index must “briefly describe the exhibit and identify the exhibit number or letter and page number.” [CRC 3.1110(f)(1)](b) [9:23.7] Deposition excerpts: Pages from a single deposition must be designated as a single exhibit. [CRC 3.1110(f)(2)]1) [9:23.7a] Format requirements: See ¶ 9:50.1.(c) [9:23.8] Foreign language exhibits: Exhibits written in a foreign language must be accompanied by an English translation, certified under oath by a qualified interpreter. [CRC 3.1110(g)][9:23.9] Reserved.(d) [9:23.10] Electronic exhibits: Unless they are submitted by a self-represented party, exhibits filed electronically “must include electronic bookmarks with links to the first page of each exhibit and with bookmark titles that identify the exhibit number or letter and briefly describe the exhibit.” [CRC 3.1110(f)(4)]➪ [9:23.11] PRACTICE POINTER: Free software programs are available that allow users to apply electronic bookmarks or hyperlinks to electronic documents. [See Adv. Comm. Comment to CRC 3.1110; for a helpful resource on creating electronic appellate filings, see Guide to Creating Electronic Documents/Filings, available on the California courts website (www.courts.ca.gov)]b. [9:24] Optional procedures: In the past, many courts had local rules governing form and content of motion papers. Although these rules have been preempted by CRC 3.20(a) (see ¶ 9:13.2), many attorneys continue to follow those procedures that are not inconsistent with the CRC rules discussed above (¶ 9:19 ff.).(1) [9:24.1] Paragraph numbering: Many courts prefer that paragraphs be numbered consecutively throughout a pleading or motion (rather than separately for each cause of action or defense); that Arabic numbers (rather than Roman numerals) be used for all primary paragraphs; and that any subparagraphs be designated by letters (rather than numbers).(2) [9:24.2] Lodge “bench book” before hearing: Where voluminous documents are involved, it is good practice to lodge a “bench book” a few days in advance. See ¶ 9:89.1.Cross-refer: “Lodging” documents with the court is discussed at ¶ 9:51 ff.c. [9:24.3] Separate vs. combined motions: Each motion or demurrer should normally be set forth in a separate document. (This includes any request for sanctions under CCP § 128.7; see ¶ 9:24.7.)However, CRC 3.1112(c) states a motion, notice of hearing and points and authorities may be combined in a single document “if the party filing a combined pleading specifies these items separately in the caption of the combined pleading.” [CRC 3.1112(c)]Comment: Although not entirely clear, CRC 3.1112(c) simply provides that all papers relating to the same motion or demurrer may be combined. It should not be read to authorize combining papers relating to separate motions.➪ [9:24.4] PRACTICE POINTER: Even if no rule expressly prohibits combining several motions in a single document, it is not recommended. The judge may not be receptive to this practice or may overlook one of the combined motions. Investigate local practices.(1) [9:24.5] Compare—motion to strike filed in conjunction with demurrer: Where a motion to strike is filed in conjunction with a demurrer, courts prefer two separately captioned documents. They should be filed concurrently, however, and set for hearing on the same date (see ¶ 7:162 ff.).Although each motion or demurrer must normally be accompanied by its own supporting papers and memorandum of authorities, some courts permit a single points and authorities for a jointly-filed motion to strike and demurrer.(2) [9:24.6] Compare—motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication: When a motion for summary adjudication of issues is filed as an alternative to a motion for summary judgment, the motions generally may be combined. But both motions must be expressly called out in the papers’ title and in the notice of motion.(3) [9:24.7] Compare—sanctions requests: Requests for sanctions in connection with discovery disputes may be made as part of a motion to compel; i.e., no separate motion is required (see ¶ 8:1980).Similarly, a request for expenses under CCP § 128.5 may be made in a party’s moving or responding papers. [CCP § 128.5(c)]But a request for sanctions under CCP §§ 128.5 or 128.7 (for violation of implied certificate of merit, including when the challenged conduct may be obviated by withdrawing a pleading or other paper) must be filed as a separate motion. [CCP §§ 128.5(f)(1)(A), 128.7(c)(1)](4) [9:24.8] Compare—combining request for dismissal on forum selection grounds with demurrer: While it may not result in forfeiture of the forum grounds, it is risky to combine a request for dismissal with a demurrer. [Laboratory Specialists Int’l, Inc. v. Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc. (2017) 17 CA5th 755, 760-761, 225 CR3d 494, 497-498—finding compliance with requirement that forum motion be filed before demurrer, even when filed at same time]➪ PRACTICE POINTERS• [9:25] Make sure your staff assistants are familiar with these rules: Copies of the CRC and any applicable local rules or policy manuals should be easily accessible to staff assistants (secretaries, paralegals, etc.). If you file papers deviating from these rules, you’re likely to run into trouble in law and motion.Don’t expect the judge to be sympathetic if your secretary fails to follow the rules, because the ultimate responsibility is yours. (As one judge puts it, “blaming foul-ups on one’s secretary is equivalent to ‘the dog ate my homework’ defense.”)• [9:26] Make it easy for the judge to read your papers: It’s up to you to make your paperwork as readable and accessible as possible. When dealing with lengthy and complex motions, you can help the judge (and yourself) by including an index, tabs for each exhibit or declaration, color codes for documents of the same kind, etc. Doing so tends to ensure your arguments will be read, rather than overlooked.d. [9:27] “Joinder” in another’s motion: It is common practice for attorneys to join in another party’s motion by simply filing a pleading captioned “Joinder in Motion of … for …,” stating that the joining party adopts the requests and the points and authorities contained in the joined motion. [See Barak v. Quisenberry Law Firm (2006) 135 CA4th 654, 660-661, 37 CR3d 688, 692-693—codefendants could join another defendant’s anti-SLAPP motion; see ¶ 7:1060](1) [9:27.1] Limitation—summary judgment: A party may not obtain a summary judgment in its favor by joining another party’s motion for summary judgment because of the requirement that each moving party file a separate statement of undisputed facts (¶ 10:95.3). [See Barak v. Quisenberry Law Firm, supra, 135 CA4th at 660-661, 37 CR3d at 692-693]➪ [9:27.2] PRACTICE POINTER: To assure your client’s interests are protected, the safest course is to file and serve your own notice of motion asking for relief specific to your client. You can incorporate the evidence and points and authorities filed by the first moving party. At the hearing, make it explicit that you want the same relief sought in the moving party’s papers for your client. A joinder may not be in order if you have different facts or authorities, or if the relief sought by the moving party would not, on its own terms, benefit your client. And the moving party may withdraw the motion. 2. [9:28] Essential Elements of Motion—Notice, Evidence, Law: The papers filed in support of a motion or demurrer must consist of at least the following:• the motion or demurrer itself (see ¶ 9:28.2);• a notice of hearing on the motion or demurrer (see ¶ 9:29 ff.); and• a memorandum of points and authorities in support of the motion or demurrer (see ¶ 9:64 ff.). [CRC 3.1112(a)]Other papers may be filed in support of a motion or demurrer, such as declarations, exhibits, appendices or other documents or pleadings. [CRC 3.1112(b)]FORM: Notice of Motion (With Attached) Memorandum in Support and Declaration, see Form 9A:1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).a. [9:28.1] Effect of incomplete papers: A motion filed without the supporting papers upon which it is based is treated as an “incomplete motion” and may be continued, placed off calendar or denied without prejudice. [Weinstein v. Blumberg (2018) 25 CA5th 316, 320-321, 235 CR3d 658, 661-662—filing notice of motion and motion without supporting papers does not comply with CCP § 1010 and does not constitute making motion, so discovery motion was untimely even if notice was timely filed]b. [9:28.2] Motion—required elements: The motion must contain the following:— identity of the party or parties bringing the motion;— identity of the parties to whom it is addressed;— a brief statement of the basis for the motion and the relief sought; and— if a pleading is challenged, the specific portion challenged. [CRC 3.1112(d)]c. [9:29] Notice: A Notice of Motion must be a separate paper stating:— the time and place of hearing (see ¶ 9:30 ff.);— the nature of the order sought and the grounds for such an order, both of which must be stated in the first paragraph of the notice (see ¶ 9:38 ff.); and— the accompanying supporting papers listed by caption (see ¶ 9:42.1). [See CCP § 1010; CRC 3.1110]• Compare—application for order: If the order is being requested by way of application rather than motion, the notice may be styled “Notice of Hearing on Application.”FORMS• Notice of Motion, see Form 9A:2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).• Notice of Hearing on Application, see Form 9A:2.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:30] Time and place of hearing: First, the notice must state the date, time and place (department of the court, room number, etc.) it will be heard and the name of the hearing judge. [CRC 3.1110(b); see ¶ 9:21]This information must be shown as part of the caption on the first page of the notice immediately below the case number; and is also customarily repeated in the opening paragraph.(a) [9:31] Minimum time limit: Absent an order shortening time, the hearing date specified in the notice must allow for service and filing of the moving papers in compliance with CCP § 1005: i.e., at least 16 court days before the hearing, plus additional time for service by mail (or by fax, email or overnight delivery); see ¶ 9:87 ff. [See Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 CA4th 393, 401, 42 CR2d 260, 265, fn. 18 (citing text) (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 90 CR2d 260)]1) [9:32] Demurrers: Demurrers are subject to the same time requirements as motions generally. A party filing a demurrer is required to file with it a notice of hearing specifying a hearing date in accordance with CCP § 1005. [CRC 3.1320(c); see ¶ 7:110][9:32.1 - 9:32.4] Reserved.2) [9:32.5] Exceptions: There are some important exceptions to the CCP § 1005(b) minimum notice requirement:• [9:32.5a] A summary judgment motion requires at least 81 days’ notice. [CCP § 437c(a) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see ¶ 10:77]• [9:32.5b] A discretionary dismissal motion based on delay in prosecution requires 45 days’ notice (except when the court moves to dismiss sua sponte, which requires 20 days’ notice). [CRC 3.1342(a), 3.1340(b); Sakhai v. Zipora (2009) 180 CA4th 593, 598, 102 CR3d 691, 695; see ¶ 11:134]• [9:32.5c] Motions on shortened time (ex parte motions) have distinct notice requirements. See ¶ 9:345 ff.[9:32.6 - 9:32.9] Reserved.3) [9:32.10] Computation of time: The applicable notice period is computed by excluding the day service was made (date of mailing, etc.) and including the last day unless it is a holiday (in which event it is also excluded). [CCP §§ 12, 12a; CRC 1.10]a) [9:32.11] Exception—court closed: If the court (other than a branch office) is closed, it is deemed a holiday for purposes of computing applicable time limits. [CCP § 12b; see Bennett v. Suncloud (1997) 56 CA4th 91, 98-99, 65 CR2d 80, 84—earthquake closures]b) [9:32.12] Exception—emergency conditions: Similarly, if an emergency condition (public calamity or danger thereof or danger to the court facility) interferes with the public’s ability to file papers, it is deemed a holiday for purposes of computing time under CCP § 12. [Gov.C. § 68115(a)(4)]c) [9:32.13] Compare—time measured backwards from hearing date: Certain acts must be performed within a specified number of days before a hearing date (e.g., motion papers must be served and filed at least 16 court days before hearing; see ¶ 9:31). The time for their performance is determined by counting backwards from the hearing date (plus any additional days required because of mailing or other method of service), excluding the day of the hearing. [CCP § 12c; see Stasz v. Eisenberg (2010) 190 CA4th 1032, 1038, 120 CR3d 21, 26](b) [9:33] Excessive notice: Except as stated below (¶ 9:33.1 ff.), there is generally no maximum time between service of a motion and the date of hearing. (CCP § 1005 requires merely “at least” 16 court days.)1) [9:33.1] Limitations on excessive notice: Excessive notice, however, is ground for denying certain procedures:• [9:33.1a] Demurrers must be noticed for hearing within 35 days after filing or on the first date available to the court thereafter. [CRC 3.1320(d); see ¶ 7:110 ff.]• [9:33.1b] A motion to dismiss for delay in service of the complaint or for delay in bringing the action to trial must be noticed for hearing within 30 days after filing the notice. [CCP § 418.10(b); see ¶ 11:110 ff.]• [9:33.1c] Likewise, a motion to quash service of summons or to stay or dismiss the complaint on forum non conveniens grounds must be noticed for hearing within 30 days after the motion is filed. [CCP § 418.10(b); see Olinick v. BMG Entertainment (2006) 138 CA4th 1286, 1295-1296, 42 CR3d 268, 275-276—hearing date more than 30 days after motion filed did not affect court’s power to rule on merits; see also ¶ 3:381]• [9:33.1d] Also, a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute (CCP § 425.16, ¶ 7:500 ff.) must be noticed for hearing within 30 days after service (not filing) of the motion unless the court’s docket conditions require a later hearing date. [See CCP § 425.16(f), ¶ 7:965]• [9:33.1e] Delays in moving for a preliminary injunction may constitute laches (see ¶ 9:520). When a preliminary injunction is sought by a request for an order to show cause in conjunction with a temporary restraining order (TRO), the hearing on the preliminary injunction may have to be heard within 15 or 22 days from the date a TRO issues. [CCP § 527(d)]2) [9:33.2] Comment: Courts generally frown on excessive notice (e.g., hearing date 60 days after service) because it may cause unnecessary delay in moving the case to trial. Also, certain motions, such as venue change requests, suspend the court’s jurisdiction (see ¶ 3:580) and therefore should be heard as rapidly as possible.[9:33.3 - 9:33.4] Reserved.(c) [9:33.5] Standards of professionalism: The California State Bar has adopted voluntary “Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism,” including standards for “Service of Papers.” [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 7—“The timing and manner of service of papers should not be used to the disadvantage of the party receiving the papers”]In addition, some courts have adopted civility guidelines as recommendations in the court’s local rules:• The time and manner of service of papers should not be used to the disadvantage of the party receiving the papers. [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(b)(1)]• Papers should not be served so close to a court appearance that it impairs opposing counsel’s ability to prepare for that appearance or, where permitted by law, to respond to the papers. [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(b)(2)]• Papers should not be served in order to take advantage of an opponent’s known absence from the office or at a time designed to inconvenience an adversary, such as late on Friday afternoon or the day preceding a secular or religious holiday. [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(b)(3)](d) [9:34] Selection of hearing date: In courts that still maintain separate law and motion departments, procedures for setting hearing dates vary:• In some courts, the moving party can set a matter for hearing on any date the court has a law and motion calendar (between the minimum and maximum time limits, ¶ 9:31 ff.). [See S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 8.2(A)(2)(a)]But in courts with direct calendar systems (where a single judge is assigned for all purposes), law and motion matters may be heard on a single day of the week, and motions must be noticed for hearing accordingly. In some courts, it is necessary to reserve a date before filing the motion.1) [9:34a] Procedure for reserving date: In general, hearing dates can be reserved by telephone. But some courts have alternative procedures:• In San Francisco Superior Court, any date in compliance with law may be selected but the hearing may be shifted by the court. [See S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 8.2(A)(1), (A)(2)(a)]• In Los Angeles Superior Court civil courtrooms, parties are directed to reserve hearing dates using the court’s online reservation system (CRS) at the Online Services section of the court’s website (www.lacourt.org). The party must provide the CRS confirmation number when electronically filing the related documents (such as the memorandum of points and authorities and proposed order).➪ [9:34.1] PRACTICE POINTER: If the court hears law and motion matters on more than one day, there may be an advantage in selecting a hearing date early in the week. If you notice your hearing on a Friday, you will not have the benefit of the weekend to work on your papers. (Because reply papers are due 5 court days before the hearing, if your hearing is on a Friday, the opposition papers normally will be served and filed on a Monday (9 court days beforehand), and your reply papers will be due that Friday (5 court days before the hearing); see ¶ 9:105.) Recall that in some courts, you may not be able to obtain a hearing for months after the reservation.(e) [9:35] Incorrect time or department: Occasionally, counsel will notice a law and motion matter in an improper department or at an incorrect time of day. The court clerk will generally calendar it in the proper department at the proper time (and notify counsel accordingly). If for any reason this cannot be done, the clerk might reject the papers.➪ [9:36] PRACTICE POINTER: If you’re not familiar with the procedures in the court in which you plan to file a motion, always check the court’s website or with the court clerk before filing.➪ [9:36.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: It is good practice to clear the hearing date with opposing counsel in advance (and in some courts, counsel are directed to do so; see, e.g., S.F. Sup.Ct. Rules 8.2(A)(2)(a), 10.0(C)). This can avoid last-minute continuances and wasted preparation.You may also wish to avoid scheduling the hearing for a Monday or any day immediately following a holiday, because court calendars tend to be unusually heavy on those days.(f) [9:37] “Notice of unavailability” disregarded: It is a common practice in some communities for lawyers to file a “notice of unavailability” to block out dates when they will be on vacation, engaged in trial elsewhere, etc. [See Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc. v. Sparks (1992) 8 CA4th 299, 301, 10 CR2d 371, 372—monetary sanctions imposed against counsel who scheduled a hearing and depositions after being notified of opposing counsel’s unavailability on those dates; and ¶ 8:506.5]Such a notice has no effect, however, on law and motion calendars and does not affect applicable time requirements. [Carl v. Sup.Ct. (Coast Comm. College Dist.) (2007) 157 CA4th 73, 75, 68 CR3d 566, 567—no authority for such notice in trial or appellate courts](2) [9:38] Statement of relief sought and grounds: The notice of motion must state in the first paragraph exactly what relief is sought and why (what grounds). [CCP § 1010; CRC 3.1110(a); see People v. American Sur. Ins. Co. (1999) 75 CA4th 719, 726, 89 CR2d 422, 427 (citing text)]The court generally cannot grant different relief, or relief on different grounds, than stated in the notice of motion. [See People v. American Sur. Ins. Co., supra, 75 CA4th at 726, 89 CR2d at 427-428; Luri v. Greenwald (2003) 107 CA4th 1119, 1124, 132 CR2d 680, 684; compare Kinda v. Carpenter (2016) 247 CA4th 1268, 1277-1278, 203 CR3d 183, 191-192—court had discretion to rule on grounds not stated in motion where no objection and parties had fair opportunity to address issues; Luxury Asset Lending, LLC v. Philadelphia Television Network, Inc. (2020) 56 CA5th 894, 908-909, 270 CR3d 724, 734-735—where memorandum of points and authorities made clear the grounds for relief sought, court “should have overlooked” omission of grounds in notice][9:39] Reserved.(a) Application• [9:39.1] Where the notice of motion states that sanctions will be sought from the opposing party, the court has no power to impose sanctions also against that party’s counsel. To justify an award against counsel, the notice of motion must apprise opposing counsel in advance of the hearing that sanctions also will be sought against the lawyer. [Blumenthal v. Sup.Ct. (Corey) (1980) 103 CA3d 317, 320, 163 CR 39, 40]• [9:39.2] Because a motion for relief from default stated it was based on “excusable neglect,” a ground for discretionary relief, it could not be considered a motion for mandatory relief based on attorney fault under CCP § 473(b) (see ¶ 5:304). [Luri v. Greenwald, supra, 107 CA4th at 1125, 132 CR2d at 685][9:39.3 - 9:39.4] Reserved.➪ [9:39.5] PRACTICE POINTER: Ask yourself whether an order that states your motion is “granted” would provide meaningful and unambiguous relief to your client. If not, revise your notice of motion to state more specifically whatever relief you are requesting.(b) [9:40] Grounds disclosed in accompanying papers: It is improper to “bury” the grounds in the points and authorities or declarations. The grounds should be stated in the first paragraph of the notice (CRC 3.1110(a), ¶ 9:38). [See In re Sutter Health Uninsured Pricing Cases (2009) 171 CA4th 495, 514, 89 CR3d 615, 631—“stray citation to a rule of court … buried at the end of a clearly-captioned” motion did not convert motion]1) [9:41] However, this is not an absolute requirement. Relief may be granted on grounds appearing anywhere in the accompanying declarations and points and authorities provided the notice states the motion will be made on grounds disclosed in the accompanying papers. [Carrasco v. Craft (1985) 164 CA3d 796, 808, 210 CR 599, 607]2) [9:42] Comment: Even so, some judges may refuse to consider grounds not clearly stated in the notice of motion, particularly if opposing counsel claims lack of fair notice.(3) [9:42.1] Designation of supporting papers: Finally, the notice must describe the various declarations or other evidence, if any, on which the motion will be based. [CCP § 1010; Cromwell v. Cummings (1998) 65 CA4th Supp. 10, 13, 76 CR2d 171, 173]The nature or title of any such documents (other than exhibits) must also appear beneath the case number; and if the documents are bound together, they must be consecutively paginated. [CRC 3.1110(b), (c); see ¶ 9:21 ff.](4) [9:42.2] Signature: The notice of motion is usually signed by the attorney for the moving party. [See CCP § 128.7—every notice of motion or similar court paper to be signed by at least one attorney of record, and state the signer’s address and telephone number]d. [9:43] Evidence: Some law and motion matters must be decided solely on the basis of the pleadings, and extrinsic evidence cannot be considered (except facts judicially noticeable)—i.e., demurrers, motions to strike and motions for judgment on the pleadings.Most other motions, however, are decided on the basis of declarations, discovery documents, or other evidence presented to the court in support of the motion.(1) [9:44] Must accompany moving papers: The original or copies of all evidence that will be presented to the court at the motion hearing must be served along with the notice of motion and points and authorities. [CCP § 1005(b); David S. Karton, a Law Corp. v. Musick, Peeler Garrett LLP (2022) 83 CA5th 1027, 1048, 300 CR3d 12, 29-30 (quoting text)]Compare—CRC 3.1113(j): CRC 3.1113(j) states that “[t]o the extent practicable, all supporting memorandums and declarations must be attached to the notice of motion.”In addition, if your motion challenges the sufficiency of a pleading already on file, you may want to supply a courtesy copy of that pleading along with your motion papers. Some local rules may require you to do so. [See, e.g., S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 8.2(A)(2)(b)][9:44.1 - 9:44.4] Reserved.(2) [9:44.5] Form of evidence: Except for OSCs re contempt (see ¶ 9:717 ff.), law and motion matters are almost always decided on the basis of declarations or other evidence in written form. [CRC 3.1306(a)](a) [9:45] Oral testimony usually not permitted: The court has discretion to receive oral testimony on a contested issue of fact in a motion hearing. [Mutual Mortgage Co. v. Avis (1986) 176 CA3d 799, 805, 222 CR 342, 345—oral testimony allowed on motion to set aside default]But the court also has discretion to refuse to allow oral testimony (and usually does so). Appellate courts will not interfere except for a clear abuse of discretion. [Eddy v. Temkin (1985) 167 CA3d 1115, 1121, 213 CR 597, 601—no abuse of discretion in refusing oral testimony on issues where documentary evidence more important than demeanor of witnesses; compare Ashburn v. AIG Fin’l Advisors, Inc. (2015) 234 CA4th 79, 98, 183 CR3d 679, 693—abuse of discretion not to hear oral testimony to resolve “significant” factual dispute on motion to compel arbitration]1) [9:45.1] Procedure for seeking leave to introduce oral testimony:a) A party seeking to introduce oral testimony (other than to rebut oral testimony presented by the opposing party) must first obtain a court order on a showing of “good cause.”b) The request must be accompanied by a statement describing the proposed testimony and the estimated time required for the hearing.c) The request and statement must be served and filed not less than 3 court days before the hearing (and if filed less than 5 court days beforehand, it must be served in a manner to assure receipt by all other parties at least 2 days before the hearing). [CRC 3.1306(b)]Failure to comply with these requirements justifies denial of the request for live testimony. [City of Crescent City v. Reddy (2017) 9 CA5th 458, 464-465, 215 CR3d 351, 356-357](b) [9:46] Declarations and affidavits: Declarations under penalty of perjury, and affidavits with jurats attached (“subscribed and sworn to” before a notary public) are the most common forms of evidence in motion hearings. [CCP § 2015.5; CRC 3.1306(a)]Declarations and affidavits are hearsay and therefore inadmissible at trial, subject to statutory exceptions. But CCP § 2009 authorizes their use in motion proceedings, creating an exception to the hearsay rule and rendering them potentially admissible evidence. (But absent some other exception to the hearsay rule, declarations must be based on personal knowledge rather than hearsay; see ¶ 9:59.) [Elkins v. Sup.Ct. (Elkins) (2007) 41 C4th 1337, 1345, 63 CR3d 483, 485; United Comm. Church v. Garcin (1991) 231 CA3d 327, 344, 282 CR 368, 380 (superseded by statute on other grounds); North Beverly Park Homeowners Ass’n v. Bisno (2007) 147 CA4th 762, 778, 54 CR3d 644, 656 (citing text)] A party’s own deposition or other discovery responses are not mentioned in CCP § 2009, so that sort of hearsay is not useful in motions.FORM: Declaration in Support of Motion with Exhibit, see Form 9A:4 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).➪ [9:46.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: Make sure your declarations include facts demonstrating the declarant’s personal observations or knowledge. For example, it is not enough for a declarant to state simply, “The light was green.” The declaration must contain additional facts showing the declarant was in a position to see the light at the relevant time.Take particular care in drafting expert witness declarations. To support an expert’s opinion, the declaration must contain facts showing the expert’s qualifications and competence to express the opinion; that the opinion is not based on speculation and rests on matters of a type reasonably relied upon by experts; and the factual basis for the opinion (see ¶ 10:124.5). If the expert’s declaration cites case-specific hearsay, that matter must be shown by otherwise admissible evidence from another witness or document. [People v. Sanchez (2016) 63 C4th 665, 686, 204 CR3d 102, 119—expert cannot “relate as true case-specific facts asserted in hearsay statements, unless they are independently proven by competent evidence or are covered by a hearsay exception”]1) [9:47] Declarations instead of affidavits: Declarations under penalty of perjury can be used in place of affidavits. [CCP § 2015.5] They are simpler to prepare because no notarization is required, and therefore are far more common.Some declarations, especially from out-of-state declarants, fail to conform to § 2015.5, instead stating they are made under penalty of perjury only under the laws of some other state or of the United States; such declarations are inadmissible in California courts (¶ 9:48).2) [9:47.1] Caption requirements: The caption of any declaration must state the name of the declarant and must identify the motion or other proceeding which it supports or opposes. [CRC 3.1115]Example: “DECLARATION OF JANE JONES IN SUPPORT OF DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.”3) [9:48] Declarations—essential wording: Declarations executed anywhere (inside or outside California) are valid if they contain the following language:“I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.“________________”(date)(signature)If this form is used, you do not have to show the place where the declaration was signed. And, the declaration is valid even if executed in a state or country whose laws do not permit declarations under penalty of perjury. [CCP § 2015.5]A declaration executed outside of California that fails to include the words “under the laws of the State of California” is inadmissible hearsay. [Kulshrestha v. First Union Comm’l Corp. (2004) 33 C4th 601, 612, 15 CR3d 793, 800, fn. 6 (citing text); ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff (2016) 1 CA5th 198, 217, 204 CR3d 566, 581—declaration not signed under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California, as required by CCP § 2015.5, had “no evidentiary value” and court refused to consider it]However, the failure to comply with CCP § 2015.5 may be cured. [Gall v. Smith & Nephew, Inc. (2021) 71 CA5th 117, 125, 286 CR3d 108, 114; Vinson v. Kinsey (2023) 93 CA5th 1166, 1178, 311 CR3d 628, 638, fn. 7—court should inform self-represented litigant in domestic violence restraining order hearing how to fix deficiencies under, e.g., CCP § 2015.5]• [9:48.1] Although it would appear obvious, a declaration must be signed by the declarant personally, not by an attorney on the declarant’s behalf. [Marriage of Reese & Guy (1999) 73 CA4th 1214, 1222-1223, 87 CR2d 339, 345][9:48.2 - 9:48.5] Reserved.• [9:48.6] Transcripts of telephone interviews in which witnesses stated orally that their statements were true under penalty of perjury did not qualify as a declaration, and therefore could not be considered in opposition to a motion. [Stockinger v. Feather River Comm. College (2003) 111 CA4th 1014, 1025, 4 CR3d 385, 393 (disapproved on other grounds by Regents of Univ. of Calif. v. Sup.Ct. (Rosen) (2018) 4 C5th 607, 634, 230 CR3d 415, 436, fn. 7)]4) [9:49] No verified pleadings in lieu of affidavit: Verified pleadings are generally not acceptable as evidence of the matters alleged because pleadings contain allegations of “ultimate” rather than “evidentiary” fact. [Strauch v. Eyring (1994) 30 CA4th 181, 186, 35 CR2d 747, 750 (citing text); see ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff, supra, 1 CA5th at 217, 204 CR3d at 581—verified complaint containing evidentiary facts may be treated as declaration]a) [9:49.1] Exception—complaint for preliminary injunction: A verified complaint can be used, however, to obtain a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, provided it contains sufficient evidentiary facts. [CCP § 527(a); see ¶ 9:579]b) [9:49.2] Limitation: Certain types of verified pleadings cannot be considered as evidence (presumably for injunctions as well): Pleadings on behalf of a corporation or public entity, verified by one of its officers, and pleadings verified by an attorney because the client is unable to verify (see ¶ 6:320) “shall not … be considered as an affidavit or declaration establishing the facts therein alleged.” [CCP § 446(a); ViaView, Inc. v. Retzlaff, supra, 1 CA5th at 217, 204 CR3d at 581—pleading verified by corporate officer inadmissible][9:49.3 - 9:49.4] Reserved.5) [9:49.5] Declarations limited to facts, not legal arguments: It is improper to include legal arguments in a declaration. (E.g., “the interests of justice require …” or “the following matters constitute ‘good cause’ …”) As noted by one court, this is “a sloppy practice which should stop … [I]t makes a mockery of the requirement that declarations be supported by statement made under penalty of perjury.” [Marriage of Heggie (2002) 99 CA4th 28, 30, 120 CR2d 707, 709, fn. 3] Nor do judges appreciate legal argument in declarations as a ruse to avoid page limits in a memorandum of points and authorities.(c) [9:50] Discovery documents: Motions are also frequently based on answers from opposing parties obtained in depositions, or to interrogatories, requests for admission, etc. In such cases, copies of the questions and answers should accompany your moving papers, except for discovery motions where the separate statement includes the summary of the question and response in dispute (see ¶ 8:1151 ff.). Parties should be prepared to lodge the executed originals of the discovery response with the court if questions arise about the authenticity of copies. (Discovery documents are not filed with the court unless the court so orders; see CCP §§ 2025.550(a), 2030.280(a), 2033.270(a), discussed in Ch. 8.) [Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 CA4th 486, 524, 121 CR3d 118, 148 (citing text)]➪ [9:50a] PRACTICE POINTER: Discovery responses are not admissible unless authenticated. Therefore, remember to attach a declaration by counsel (or the court reporter present at a deposition) confirming that the attached responses were actually given in discovery in the case.1) [9:50.1] Deposition transcripts: It is rarely necessary or proper to attach an entire deposition transcript as an exhibit to a motion. Only the title page (stating the name of the deponent and date of deposition) and the “relevant pages” should be included. [CRC 3.1116(a), (b)]➪ [9:50.2] PRACTICE POINTER: Don’t read “relevant” too narrowly. It may be necessary to include a few pages leading up to critical testimony in order to give it context.• [9:50.3] Title page: The first page of any such exhibit shall state the name of the deponent and the date of the deposition. [CRC 3.1116(a)]The title page of the deposition transcript normally contains this information as well as the case caption and other information.• [9:50.4] Page numbering: The page number from the original transcript must be clearly visible on each page of deposition excerpts. [CRC 3.1116(b)]• [9:50.5] Relevant passages highlighted: The relevant portion of the testimony should be marked in a manner that calls attention to the testimony. [CRC 3.1116(c)]➪ [9:50.6] PRACTICE POINTER: The easiest way to call attention to the relevant testimony as required by the rules is to bracket the lines of the transcript.In addition, because some judges prefer highlighting crucial testimony with a colored marker, it may be a good idea to add such marking to the court’s copy. This should be done on all copies, including copies served on opposing counsel, and, of course, your own copy.2) [9:51] “Lodging”: When the court orders original discovery documents lodged with the court, they must be delivered to the court clerk before the hearing, together with a self-addressed, stamped envelope for return after the hearing to the party lodging the documents. [See CRC 3.1302(b)]Alternatively, some courts permit leaving an attorney-service pick-up slip with the lodged materials. But it is counsel’s responsibility to make sure the attorney service picks up the papers after the hearing without reminder from the court clerk. (Do not ask the court clerk to contact the messenger.)If the material is lodged electronically, it must specify the electronic address to which a notice of deletion may be sent. After determination of the matter, the clerk may permanently delete the electronically lodged material after sending notice of the deletion to the party who lodged it. [CRC 3.1302(b)]3) [9:51.1] Notice of lodging: As an accommodation to the court and to opposing parties, it is good practice to file and serve a “Notice of Lodging” listing all of the items lodged.➪ [9:52] PRACTICE POINTER: Ask opposing counsel to stipulate to using the copies attached to the moving papers in lieu of the originals. This will avoid any necessity of “lodging” documents with the court clerk. But be sure to mention such stipulation in your moving papers, or advise the court clerk, so that the judge won’t be looking for the originals when reviewing the motion.(d) [9:53] Other documentary evidence: Motions may also be based on admissions made in the opposing party’s pleadings; or on other documentary evidence generally.When relying on evidence contained in other documents, it is good practice to set forth the full text or portion relied upon, or to attach a copy to the moving papers.Where opposing pleadings are relied upon, they may simply be incorporated by reference into declarations supporting the motion. Where other documentary evidence is offered, a proper foundation should be laid for such documents in supporting declarations; and although copies may be attached to the moving papers, the original or certified copy of the document should be offered at the hearing.1) [9:53a] Authentication: A writing must be authenticated by declarations or other evidence establishing that the writing is what it purports to be. [Ev.C. §§ 250, 1401(a); see O’Laskey v. Sortino (1990) 224 CA3d 241, 273 CR 674 (disapproved on other grounds by Flanagan v. Flanagan (2002) 27 C4th 766, 117 CR2d 574)—transcript of tape recording not enough to authenticate accuracy of tape]It is routine in law-and-motion practice for the moving party’s attorneys, who have personal knowledge of the attached exhibits, to attach declarations establishing their authenticity (i.e., how they obtained the documents, who identified them, and their status as “true and correct” copies of the originals). [Greenspan v. LADT, LLC (2010) 191 CA4th 486, 523, 121 CR3d 118, 147] (Recall, however, that the mere fact that the document was produced by the other side in discovery does not mean it has been authenticated.)2) [9:53.1] Copies generally admissible: The “Secondary Evidence Rule” allows use of authenticated photocopies (or other secondary evidence) of a document instead of the original, unless:— a genuine dispute exists concerning material terms of the document and “justice” requires exclusion of copies; or— admission of secondary evidence would be “unfair” under the circumstances. [See Ev.C. § 1521(a)]3) [9:53.1a] Admissibility of contents: It is not necessary to ask the court to take judicial notice of materials previously filed in the case; you should simply call the court’s attention to such papers. But except for admissions in pleadings, those materials may not be admissible for the truth of the matter.4) [9:53.2] Limitation: On motions for summary judgment on a contract or promissory note, the original note must still be produced upon entry of judgment, so that the court clerk may mark it “paid” or “cancelled.” [CRC 3.1806; see ¶ 10:176](e) [9:54] Judicial notice: A party may also base a motion on undisputed facts or events of which the judge may or must take judicial notice. [Ev.C. § 452—matters which may be judicially noticed; Ev.C. § 453—court “shall” take notice of any matter under Ev.C. § 452 if proper notice given (¶ 9:56.1)]The most common situation is where judicial notice is requested of court files in other lawsuits (e.g., as the basis for a claim of res judicata or abuse of process). The court may take judicial notice of the fact of the filing of a particular document in another case and of any judicial action taken in such a case. However, absent an exception to the hearsay rule, such as an admission, the court may not take judicial notice of the truth of allegations contained in such files. [See Richtek USA, Inc. v. uPI Semiconductor Corp. (2015) 242 CA4th 651, 659-660, 195 CR3d 430, 437—improper for court to judicially notice truth of allegations in foreign complaints; Dominguez v. Bonta (2022) 87 CA5th 389, 400, 303 CR3d 115, 126]The judicial notice request must be a separate document that is typically served with the moving or opposing papers. Do not bury your request in another document—e.g., memorandum of points and authorities. [See CRC 3.1113(l); and ¶ 7:13 ff.]FORM: Request for Judicial Notice, see Form 9A:5 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).1) [9:55] Files of same court: A party requesting the court to take notice of material in another case file in the same court must: (a) file a written “Request for Judicial Notice,” directing the court’s attention to the part of the other file sought to be judicially noticed; and (b) make arrangements with the clerk to have the file in the courtroom at the time of the hearing or confirm with the clerk that the file is electronically accessible to the court. [CRC 3.1113(l), 3.1306(c)]If the file must be physically delivered to the courtroom, the “Request” should be filed well in advance of the hearing to enable the court staff to obtain the other file in time. [CRC 3.1113(l), 3.1306(c)]➪ [9:55.1] PRACTICE POINTER: It is a good practice to attach to your motion photocopies of whatever papers from the other file you want the court to notice. That way, if that file cannot be obtained in time for the hearing, the court may still be able to proceed (assuming your photocopies are accepted as correct by the opposing party).2) [9:56] Files of another court: To enable the court to take judicial notice of case files in another court, the party seeking such notice must either serve a subpoena duces tecum on the court clerk of the other court, or (preferably) obtain certified copies of the file in question, and attach them to the moving papers. [Ross v. Creel Printing & Publishing Co., Inc. (2002) 100 CA4th 736, 743, 122 CR2d 787, 791-792—Nevada complaint not judicially noticeable because neither certified nor produced in response to a subpoena]3) [9:56.1] Copies to be provided: A party requesting judicial notice of any materials under Ev.C. §§ 452 or 453 must provide the court and each opposing party with copies of the material to be so noticed. [CRC 3.1306(c); see Ev.C. § 453; Creed-21 v. City of San Diego (2015) 234 CA4th 488, 519-520, 184 CR3d 128, 152—although ordinance qualified for judicial notice under Ev.C. § 452, request properly denied due to insufficient information given under Ev.C. § 453](3) [9:57] Admissibility of evidence: The evidence submitted to the court must meet all statutory requirements for admissibility of evidence at trial. The standards are the same as for evidence presented by a live witness. Basically, this means the declarations must be from competent witnesses having personal knowledge of the facts stated therein, rather than hearsay or conclusions. [Pajaro Valley Water Mgmt. Agency v. McGrath (2005) 128 CA4th 1093, 1107, 27 CR3d 741, 751]However, anti-SLAPP motions may have a different evidentiary standard. [See Sweetwater Union High School Dist. v. Gilbane Building Co. (2019) 6 C5th 931, 947, 243 CR3d 880, 891—even if not admissible, evidentiary showing may be satisfied “if it is reasonably possible the evidence … will be admissible at trial”; see ¶ 7:1020](a) [9:58] Competency of declarant: A declaration is a substitute for oral testimony, and therefore must conform to the same requirements of competency as would be applicable to testimony in court. For example, if special qualifications are necessary to allow a person to give opinion testimony in court, such qualifications must be set forth in detail in declarations containing such testimony. [Ochoa v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. (1998) 61 CA4th 1480, 1487, 72 CR2d 232, 236—declaration lacked sufficient foundation for opinion expressed]1) [9:58.1] Not established by own conclusory declaration: Declarations often recite, “I am competent to testify to the matters contained in this declaration, which are true of my own knowledge.”But this is purely a legal conclusion and proves nothing. The declarant’s competency must appear from the facts alleged in the declaration (e.g., that the declarant saw what happened or heard what was said; see ¶ 10:110 ff.).(b) [9:59] Personal knowledge of declarant: It is not enough for the declaration simply to state the declarant has personal knowledge of the facts stated. Rather, the declaration itself must contain facts showing the declarant’s connection with the matters stated therein, establishing the source of the declarant’s information. Otherwise, the declarant’s statement about such knowledge is purely a conclusion. [See Ev.C. § 702; and Osmond v. EWAP, Inc. (1984) 153 CA3d 842, 851, 200 CR 674, 679]1) [9:60] “On information and belief”: A declaration on information and belief is proper only where permitted by statute (e.g., to verify pleadings; see CCP § 446) or “where the facts to be established are incapable of positive averment.” [City of Santa Cruz v. Mun.Ct. (Kennedy) (1989) 49 C3d 74, 86, 260 CR 520, 527 (emphasis added)]“Information and belief” indicates the statement is not based on the declarant’s firsthand knowledge but that person nevertheless, in good faith, believes the statement to be true. [City of Santa Cruz v. Mun.Ct. (Kennedy), supra, 49 C3d at 93, 260 CR at 532, fn. 9]“Information and belief” indicates the declarant has information supporting an inference believed to be true. [Doe v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 42 C4th 531, 550, 67 CR3d 330, 344; Gomes v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (2011) 192 CA4th 1149, 1158-1159, 121 CR3d 819, 827] “Information and belief” is not an excuse for pure speculation.Generally, a declaration on information and belief is inadmissible. But such declarations have been held sufficient in some contexts where the facts would otherwise be difficult or impossible to establish. For example:• [9:60.1] To allege bias, prejudice, etc. on a motion for disqualification of a trial judge. [See Blackman v. MacCoy (1959) 169 CA2d 873, 879-880, 338 P2d 234, 236]• [9:60.2] To allege a third party’s residence on a motion for change of venue. [See Brown v. Happy Valley Fruit Growers (1929) 206 Cal. 515, 520-521, 274 P 977, 979]• [9:60.3] To show “good cause” for discovery of peace or custodial officer personnel records under Ev.C. § 1043. [See City of Santa Cruz v. Mun.Ct. (Kennedy), supra, 49 C3d at 88, 260 CR at 528]• [9:60.4] To show state of mind where that is in issue; e.g., in response to a motion for sanctions, to explain why a certain motion was made, why certain discovery was sought, etc.• [9:60.5] To show a medical diagnosis and prognosis in support of a trial preference motion under CCP § 36(a). [CCP § 36.5][9:60.6 - 9:60.7] Reserved.[9:60.8] Compare: Statutes may also preclude declarations on information and belief: e.g., CCP § 437c(d) requires declarations in support of a motion for summary judgment to be made on the basis of “personal knowledge” (not information and belief). See ¶ 10:107 ff.2) [9:60.9] “To the best of my knowledge”: A declaration stating it is “to the best of my knowledge” is not defective if actually and demonstrably based on personal knowledge. But the phrase “introduces an element of uncertainty which, under certain circumstances, can be lethal.” [Pelayo v. J.J. Lee Mgmt. Co., Inc. (2009) 174 CA4th 484, 494, 94 CR3d 502, 510 (emphasis in original)—upholding trial court’s decision to accept declaration, impliedly finding no uncertainty as to declarant’s knowledge]➪ [9:60.10] PRACTICE POINTER: Avoid this phrase and any others that raise questions about whether the declarant in fact has personal knowledge. They create a risk that the court may refuse to consider the evidence.3) [9:61] Declarations by counsel: Declarations by moving party’s counsel as to material facts are generally objectionable and inadmissible as hearsay, except where the lawyer somehow has personal knowledge of the facts. [See Star Motor Imports, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Shake) (1979) 88 CA3d 201, 203-205, 151 CR 721, 723-724]a) [9:62] Compare: But if the material facts appear in pleadings, discovery documents, etc. already on file (or otherwise before the court at the hearing), the moving party’s lawyer may execute a declaration stating the lawyer’s personal knowledge of their contents, and recite (or summarize) such information to support the relief sought. [See Star Motor Imports, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Shake) (1979) 88 CA3d 201, 203-205, 151 CR 721, 723-724]b) [9:62.1] Not verified pleadings: Remember, however, that pleadings verified by an attorney (where the client is unable to do so) are not admissible as evidence of the facts stated therein. [CCP § 446(a); see ¶ 9:49.2](c) [9:63] Failure to object as waiver: If the opposing party fails to object to hearsay or other inadmissible evidence contained in the moving party’s declarations, the court may consider them. I.e., the evidentiary objection is waived by failure to assert it. [CCP § 437c(d) (summary judgment motions); Broden v. Marin Humane Soc. (1999) 70 CA4th 1212, 1226-1227, 83 CR2d 235, 243, fn. 13 (other motions); Schoendorf v. U.D. Registry, Inc. (2002) 97 CA4th 227, 240, 118 CR2d 313, 322, fn. 2 (citing text); Ev.C. § 353(a)]The court should not exclude evidence on its own motion unless it is “irrelevant, unreliable, misleading, or prejudicial.” [Gonzalez v. Santa Clara County Dept. of Social Services (2017) 9 CA5th 162, 173, 215 CR3d 22, 32 (emphasis and internal quotes omitted)](d) [9:63.1] Ruling unnecessary to preserve objections: Evidentiary objections not ruled upon by the trial court are presumed overruled and preserved for appellate review. [Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 C4th 512, 532, 113 CR3d 327, 344; Jolley v. Chase Home Finance, LLC (2013) 213 CA4th 872, 890, 153 CR3d 546, 561; Zucchet v. Galardi (2014) 229 CA4th 1466, 1480, 178 CR3d 363, 373, fn. 7]This rule has essentially been codified for purposes of motions for summary judgment and summary adjudication. [CCP § 437c(q)—court need only rule on material objections to evidence and evidentiary objections not ruled on are preserved for appellate review; see ¶ 10:210.4]➪ [9:63.2] PRACTICE POINTER: To increase the likelihood the court will rule on your evidentiary objections, make the court’s job easier. Submit objections to evidence in the format set forth in CRC 3.1354 and include a checkbox for the court to indicate whether it has sustained or overruled each objection. Also, only make truly important objections (such as those you would make at trial) and avoid making multiple objections to the same evidence.e. [9:64] Points and authorities: The third essential element of any motion is supporting points and authorities. [CRC 3.1112(a); see ¶ 9:28]Without such a memorandum, the motion is incomplete and cannot be granted (CRC 3.1112(a)). Indeed, the court may treat the failure to provide the memorandum as an admission that the motion is not meritorious and cause for its denial. [CRC 3.1113(a)](1) [9:64.1] Must accompany notice: A memorandum of points and authorities must accompany every notice of motion except those listed in CRC 3.1114 (¶ 9:64.6). [CRC 3.1113(a); see Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Assocs., Inc. (2011) 197 CA4th 927, 932, 130 CR3d 92, 97—requirement applies to post-trial motions]The memorandum must be served and filed along with and physically attached to the notice of motion “[t]o the extent practicable.” [CRC 3.1113(j)][9:64.2 - 9:64.5] Reserved.(a) [9:64.6] Exceptions: No supporting memorandum is necessary in connection with the following motions filed on Judicial Council forms:— Application for appointment of guardian ad litem in a civil case;— Application for an order extending time to serve pleading;— Motion to be relieved as counsel;— Motion filed in small claims case;— Petition for change of name or gender;— Petition for declaration of emancipation of minor;— Petition for injunction prohibiting harassment;— Petition for protective order to prevent elder or dependent adult abuse;— Petition for order to prevent postsecondary school violence;— Petition of employer for injunction prohibiting workplace violence;— Petition for order prohibiting abuse (transitional housing);— Petition to approve compromise of claim of a minor or person with a disability;— Petition for withdrawal of funds from blocked account. [CRC 3.1114(a)]A party may choose to file a memorandum in support of any of these motions if it would further the interests of justice; or the court may order such a memorandum. [See CRC 3.1114(b)](2) [9:64.7] Content, generally: The memorandum “must contain a statement of facts, a concise statement of the law, evidence and arguments relied on, and a discussion of the statutes, cases and textbooks cited in support of the position advanced.” [CRC 3.1113(b); see Quantum Cooking Concepts, Inc. v. LV Assocs., Inc., supra, 197 CA4th at 934, 130 CR3d at 98—trial court not required to “comb the record and the law for factual and legal support that a party has failed to identify or provide”; and ¶ 9:68.5 ff.]FORM: Memorandum in Support of Motion, see Form 9A:3 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(a) [9:64.7a] Need not be organized on cause of action basis: A memorandum that complies with CRC 3.1113(b) cannot be disregarded because it is not structured on a cause of action by cause of action basis favored by the trial court. [Hope Int’l Univ. v. Sup.Ct. (Rouanzoin) (2004) 119 CA4th 719, 731, 14 CR3d 643, 651](3) [9:64.8] Style: A memorandum must consistently follow either the “California Style Manual” or “The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation” as to such matters as citations, abbreviations, capitalization, punctuation, etc. [CRC 1.200]➪ [9:64.9] PRACTICE POINTER: The “California Style Manual” is available from the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of California. It is also available online from a number of sources (e.g., www.sdap.org).(4) [9:64.10] Length: No opening or responding memorandum of points and authorities shall exceed 15 pages in length, except a 20-page limit applies to motions:— for summary judgment or adjudication; or— to certify or decertify a class, or to amend or modify a class certification order. [CRC 3.1113(d), 3.764(c)(2)]No reply or closing memorandum of points and authorities shall exceed 10 pages in length except a 15-page limit applies to class certification motions. [CRC 3.1113(d), 3.764(c)(2)]The caption page, notice of motion, exhibits, declarations and other attachments (including tables of contents and authorities, and proof of service) are not counted as part of these page limits. [CRC 3.1113(d)](a) [9:64.11] Ex parte order for longer briefs: A party may apply to the court ex parte (i.e., on shortened time, see ¶ 9:345) for permission to file a longer memorandum. Such application must be made at least 24 hours before the brief is due and after written notice of the application to other parties (¶ 9:64.12). The application must state reasons why the argument cannot be made within the above page limit (¶ 9:64.10). [CRC 3.1113(e)]1) [9:64.12] Caution—written notice required: Ordinarily, ex parte orders may issue after oral (e.g., telephone) notice to opposing counsel as to when and where the application will be made; see ¶ 9:351 ff. But CRC 3.1113(e) requires a written notice at least 24 hours before the memorandum is due on applications for permission to file longer briefs.CCP § 1013 allows service by fax where parties consent to this form of service (see ¶ 9:86.10) or email where electronic service is authorized or required (see ¶ 9:86.25 ff.). In addition, where a court has adopted efiling, electronic service may take place incident to the filing (see ¶ 9:86.25 ff.). Although no appellate court has addressed whether fax or electronic service, instead of mail or personal service, satisfy the written notice requirement, presumably they do.➪ [9:64.12a] PRACTICE POINTER: Do not assume your request for permission to file a longer memorandum will be approved. Have a backup plan to file memoranda within the prescribed length limits.(b) [9:64.13] More lines per page? CRC 2.108 permits either double-spacing or 1 1/2 spaces between lines (see ¶ 9:22). Switching to 1 1/2 spaces between lines substantially increases the amount of information on each page.If you are going to use 1 1/2 spacing, you will need special 37-line paper, because each line must be numbered (CRC 2.108).➪ [9:64.14] PRACTICE POINTER: Use of 1 1/2 spacing is not recommended. It makes your memo difficult to read and is a “turn off” to most judges. It is better to stick with double-spacing and get permission to file a longer brief.1) [9:64.15] Single spacing: Single spacing with unnumbered lines is permissible in footnotes and in quotations. [See CRC 2.108(3)]➪ [9:64.16] PRACTICE POINTER: But don’t try to evade the 15-page limit by using lengthy, single-spaced footnotes. They may not be read and may be understood as a deliberate attempt to avoid the page limit.(c) [9:64.17] Effect of violating page limit: A memorandum exceeding the permissible page limits “must be filed and considered in the same manner as a late-filed paper”; i.e., the court in its discretion may refuse to consider it in ruling on the motion (see ¶ 9:105.4). [CRC 3.1113(g) (emphasis added), 3.1300(d)][9:65] Reserved.(5) [9:66] Tables of contents, authorities: If the memo is over 10 pages, it must contain both a table of contents and a table of authorities. [CRC 3.1113(f)]➪ [9:66.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Even for shorter memoranda, such tables are recommended. They help the court follow your arguments.(6) [9:66.2] Pagination: If tables of contents and authorities are included:— the caption page (“Points and Authorities in Support of …”) need not be numbered; and— the text must be numbered consecutively using Arabic numerals. [CRC 3.1113(h)](7) [9:67] Case citations: Case citations must be to the Official Reports (“Cal.” and “Cal.App.”) and must include the volume, page number and year of decision. The court may not require any other form of citation. [CRC 3.1113(c)]➪ [9:67.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Even if not required, it is good practice to include internal “jump” or “pin” cites (the specific page at which the quotation or cited matter appears).If you cite to a case decided by the court of appeal for the district in which your action is pending, you may wish to show this in the citation (e.g., “Jones v. Smith (2d Dist. 1994).” However, the opinions of the various district courts of appeal are equally binding on all trial courts. [People v. Bullock (1994) 26 CA4th 985, 990, 31 CR2d 850, 854](a) [9:67.2] Categories of authority: Case authority is either (i) “persuasive” (more accurately, “potentially persuasive”) or (ii) “binding” (also referred to as “precedential”).

Sup.Ct. (Hesenflow) (1962) 57 C2d 450, 456, 20 CR 321, 324). Other relevant authority is “potentially persuasive,” which means it may be considered. [See, e.g., Troester v. Starbucks Corp.

[CRC 3.1113(f)]Comment: Although not required, such a summary may be helpful to the judge even in shorter memoranda.➪ [9:69] PRACTICE POINTERS RE DRAFTING: The primary purpose of your memorandum or brief is to persuade the judge. In the process of persuasion, how you present your arguments is almost as important as what you have to say. Here are some guidelines to effective brief-writing in law and motion matters:(a) [9:70] Introduction: To grab the judge’s attention right away, start off with a summary of what the case is all about, and what order you are seeking. This will help the judge focus on the issues and comprehend your arguments. No matter how complex the case, keep your introduction short and crystal-clear, never more than a page or two in length.Even if the judge has heard earlier motions in the case, do not assume the judge remembers everything that went before. Therefore, begin with any prior orders relevant to the present motion. Then, briefly state whatever has led up to the filing of the motion or the context in which the motion arises.• [9:71] Present your client’s version of the facts: Your introductory paragraphs should summarize the facts in the light most favorable to your client. At the law and motion stage, you usually are not bound by any findings of fact (unlike the situation on appeal). You are therefore free to be a true advocate, and to present the facts in the most persuasive manner you can. Obviously, you may not misstate the facts to the court (CRPC 3.3). But you are certainly free to argue whatever reasonable inferences you believe are supported by the facts. (Keep in mind, however, that nothing destroys credibility more quickly than exaggerating or misstating the facts.)Moreover, your summary of the facts can be used in any later memorandum or brief you write in the same case. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using the same introductory paragraphs more than once. Indeed, doing so will aid the judge in recalling the case and getting back into focus on the issues involved.• [9:72] State precisely what order you seek, and why: After you tell the judge what the case is about, state precisely what relief or order you are asking the judge to make, and on what ground or grounds. For example, “By this motion, defendant (name) seeks an order transferring this action to Alameda County on the ground that it has been filed in the wrong court; and for reimbursement for his expenses and reasonable attorney fees.”(b) [9:73] Argument: Following the introductory paragraph, it is your job to make relevant points (arguments), and to support them with relevant authorities.• [9:73.1] Use logical sequence: The “IRAC” outline (Issue, Rule, Analysis, Conclusion) you learned in law school provides a useful sequence for memoranda of points and authorities.• [9:74] Avoid abstractions: A common failing is to set forth black-letter legal principles that could apply virtually to any case in the court. (E.g., “A demurrer lies for failure to state a cause of action.”)Instead, tie your points into the particular facts of the case. (E.g., “The complaint fails to state a cause of action for defamation against defendant newspaper, because it fails to allege a demand for retraction before suit.”)Consider if the outcome is determined by precedent, in which event you should stress the controlling authority; or is a matter of discretion, in which case you should focus on practicalities and fairness.• [9:75] Use common sense re citations: A judge is bound to follow applicable appellate decisions. Hence, a single holding on point is all that you need. (String cites are unnecessary, and can get you into trouble if you haven’t read all of the cases, and the judge has. Also, if you have a case on point, the judge may never get around to reading it if it is buried in a string of cites.)Obviously, cite California Supreme Court decisions wherever possible; and later decisions, rather than earlier—unless the earlier is a landmark or “fountainhead” on the point involved.Always “KeyCite” or “Shepardize” your cites to make sure they are still good law, and also possibly to pick up a later case that may be even stronger authority for the point you are making.On recent cases, check the subsequent histories to make sure that the opinion has not been amended, withdrawn, depublished or had review granted.• [9:75.1] Avoid footnotes: Most judges are used to seeing case citations in the text. Footnotes are distracting and may divert the judge’s attention from the thrust of your arguments.• [9:76] Use short quotes: Of course, you need to discuss the facts of the cases you cite to show their relevancy to the matter before the court. But don’t summarize the holding. Most judges would rather read a direct quotation of the language you are relying upon than your characterization of the holding. (Indeed, if you fail to include such quotation, some judges may think either the issue is not so clear as you say, or that you may be misreading the holding of the case.)Be careful not to “edit” your quotation unfairly. You may safely assume that your opponent or the judge (or both) will read the whole opinion, and will jump on any distortion.• [9:77] Be clear about opposing authority: If there are cases which appear to be against you, say so. Obviously, attempt to distinguish them, but in any case, be sure to cite them. There are several reasons: First, you owe a duty to the court to cite all relevant authority, including adverse authority (CRPC 3.3(a)(2)) prohibits lawyers from failing “to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction known to the lawyer to be directly adverse to the position of the client”). Second, by citing the adverse authority before your opponent does, you may take some of the “steam” out of your opponent’s arguments. Finally, whether or not your opponent cites the case, the judge may be aware of it, and may view your failure to cite it as incompetence or an attempt to mislead the court.• [9:78] Make it easy for the judge: Always cite the official reports (“Cal.” and “Cal. App.”) and year of decision (see California Style Manual § 2:6). Although not required, be sure to include internal page references (also known as “jump” or “pin” cites) to help the judge locate the relevant portion of the case (see ¶ 9:67.1).Subsequent references to the same case may use a shortened citation form (e.g., Flanagan, supra, 27 C4th at 767); however, avoid using “supra” without the reporter volume (e.g., Flanagan, supra, at 767) since it may force the judge to search for earlier citation to the case.If you are citing an important out-of-state or federal case or statute, it is a good idea to attach a copy to your memorandum, even if the judge does not order you to do so (see ¶ 9:67.3). The judge simply may not have the time to look it up. The same observation applies to administrative regulations.• [9:79] Keep your arguments “bite size”: Your brief will do its job better if it is easy to read. Always start a separate paragraph for each point you are making, and preface it with a caption or “headline,” underlined or capitalized. Then, lay out your arguments in short paragraphs (several to a page enhance readability). Finally, avoid long convoluted sentences; the judge may simply not have the time or patience to wade through them.• [9:80] Don’t “trash” your opponent: Judges react negatively to name-calling in briefs or oral argument. Avoid petty remarks demeaning the opposing party or counsel.Standards for professionalism: “Trashing” an opponent may also violate civility guidelines in local rules. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(c)(2)—“Neither written submissions nor oral presentations should disparage the intelligence, ethics, morals, integrity or personal behavior of one’s adversaries, unless such things are directly and necessarily in issue”]• [9:80a] Don’t argue facts not properly before the court: Limit your arguments to facts contained in supporting affidavits and other evidence properly before the court (see ¶ 9:43 ff.). Referring to other facts is likely to undermine your credibility with the court.By the same token, failure to mention a declaration or other evidence in your memorandum may suggest to the judge it is not important. [See Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 471, 506, 180 CR3d 234, 264-265—exhibits not mentioned in briefs were “irrelevant”]• [9:80.1] Be respectful to the court: No matter how much you may disagree with any prior rulings or remarks by the judge, keep a respectful tone in your arguments. An attack on the integrity of the court is bound to hurt your client’s case. Beware of manifestations of gender and other biases. [Briganti v. Chow (2019) 42 CA5th 504, 510-512, 254 CR3d 909, 914-915; Martinez v. O’Hara (2019) 32 CA5th 853, 857-858, 244 CR3d 226, 229-230](c) [9:81] Conclusion: After you have summarized the case, summarized the motion, and presented your arguments, summarize once more: Restate exactly what relief or order you are requesting and on what grounds. This will make it easier for the judge to incorporate in the ruling.(d) [9:81.1] Redraft: Good briefs are not written; they are rewritten. Leave enough time to redraft. Tighten up your arguments. Improve the flow. Be succinct. Search for a way to make the brief more interesting.f. [9:81.2] Proposed order: If a proposed order is submitted, it must be lodged and served with the moving papers, but not attached to them. [CRC 3.1113(m); see further discussion at ¶ 9:294]FORM: Proposed Order (Submitted with Motion), see Form 9A:8 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).➪ [9:81.2a] PRACTICE POINTER: Most judges prefer that you designate a proposed order as such (e.g., “(Proposed) Order Granting …”). The judge signing the order will then merely strike out the word “Proposed.” This avoids confusion created by documents in the court file which are denominated “Order” but which have not been adopted or signed by the court (see ¶ 9:300).(1) [9:81.3] Comment: Proposed orders rarely work in complicated cases. The judge usually finds it easier to dictate a minute order than to rewrite orders proposed by counsel. Unless waived or otherwise ordered, a new attorney order is then required (CRC 3.1312; see ¶ 9:294 ff.).Nevertheless, sometimes proposed orders can be helpful in that they force the moving party to spell out exactly what is being requested.(2) [9:81.4] Attorney designation: The name, address, etc. of the attorney submitting the proposed order should appear on the first page of the order. [CRC 2.111(1); see ¶ 6:21] 3. Service Requirementsa. [9:82] Papers served: The papers served must be copies of the moving and supporting papers filed or to be filed with the court. [CCP § 1005][9:82.1 - 9:82.4] Reserved.b. [9:82.5] Who must be served: The moving papers must be served on all parties who have appeared in the action, whether or not the motion seeks relief against such parties.

(Schroeder) (2000) 82 CA4th 719, 727, 98 CR2d 413, 419—service of notice not required on defendants who have not yet appeared](1) [9:83] On counsel for party; exceptions: Where a party has appeared through an attorney, service of papers must be made on the attorney rather than the party except for subpoenas, writs, OSCs to hold the party in contempt, and “other process issued in the suit.” [CCP § 1015](a) [9:83a] Motion to vacate dismissal: The attorney-client relationship does not go on indefinitely after a case is over. However, it continues long enough after a case has been dismissed to allow service on defense counsel of plaintiff’s motion to vacate the dismissal on CCP § 473 grounds (e.g., mistake). [Maxwell v. Cooltech, Inc. (1997) 57 CA4th 629, 632, 67 CR2d 293, 295](b) [9:83b] Parties represented by several counsel: Where a party is represented by several separate attorneys or law firms of record, notice served on any of them (presumably the first-named) is apparently effective. [See Adaimy v. Ruhl (2008) 160 CA4th 583, 588, 72 CR3d 926, 929—notice of judgment entry served by clerk on one of two attorneys of record triggered time for filing appeal][9:83c] Comment: Adaimy (¶ 9:83b) involved service by the court clerk. Logically, however, the same rule should apply to service by a party.➪ [9:83d] PRACTICE POINTER: Avoid the uncertainty. Serve copies on each separate attorney or law firm of record for a party.(2) [9:83.1] List of parties: To facilitate service in multiparty lawsuits, court rules require the first-named plaintiff to maintain a list of the parties and their addresses for service of notice. Such list is required in any case where more than two parties have appeared and are represented by different counsel. Each party must advise the plaintiff of any change in address, so the list is kept current. [CRC 3.254]The list of parties must be furnished on request to the court or to any party. And, it must be served with any notice or pleading served on a party who has not yet appeared in the action. [CRC 3.254]c. [9:84] How served: Service of moving and opposing papers is governed by CCP § 1005. The moving papers can be served either by:— personal delivery (see ¶ 9:85);— mail (typically first class) (see ¶ 9:86a);— express mail “or another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery” (see ¶ 9:86.7 ff.);— fax transmission, where the parties have a written agreement to accept service by fax (see ¶ 9:86.10); or— electronic service where authorized or required (see ¶ 9:86.25 ff.).(1) [9:85] Personal service on attorney: Service may be made on a party’s attorney by leaving the papers with a receptionist or anyone in charge of the office. If there is no one with whom to leave the papers, they may be left in a conspicuous place in the office between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. [CCP § 1011(a); see National Advertising Co. v. City of Rohnert Park (1984) 160 CA3d 614, 618-619, 206 CR 696, 698](a) [9:85.1] Proof of service: A declaration of personal service is required by the person delivering the documents.FORM: Proof of Personal Service—Civil (optional Judicial Council form POS-020).➪ [9:85.2] PRACTICE POINTER: If you are going to use a messenger to serve documents on opposing counsel or parties, the proof of service must be by the messenger. A declaration signed by a secretary who gave the papers to the messenger is hearsay and not sufficient.For the same reason, a declaration by the attorney (e.g., “I caused to be delivered by hand”) is likewise insufficient. If you are relying on personal service, the person who actually served the document must sign the proof of service.(b) [9:85.2a] Where delivery to office impossible: If the attorney’s office is not open and the attorney’s residence is in the same county as the office, service may be made by leaving the papers at the attorney’s residence with someone at least 18 years old. [CCP § 1011(a)]If these requirements cannot be met, the papers may be served by mailing them to the attorney’s office address, if known, or otherwise to the attorney’s residence address. [CCP § 1011(a)](c) [9:85.2b] Where attorney’s address unknown: If the attorney’s office and residence are both unknown, the notice or papers for the attorney may be delivered to either:— the address designated on the court papers for the attorney or party of record; or— to the clerk of the court. [CCP § 1011(a)](d) [9:85.3] Compare—service on self-represented party: Parties not represented by counsel may be served personally or by leaving papers at their residence (not office) between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. with someone at least 18 years old. [CCP § 1011(b)(1)]If no one age 18 or older is found at the time of attempted service, the papers may be served by mail. If the party’s residence is not known, service may be made by delivering the papers to the clerk of the court. [CCP § 1011(b)(2), (3)]Where a party has no permanent residence, papers may be served at the address the party has provided the court for service. [Sweeting v. Murat (2013) 221 CA4th 507, 513-514, 164 CR3d 383, 388—where party’s listed address was rented mailbox at UPS Store, personal service properly effected by personal delivery of papers to UPS Store](2) [9:86] Service by mail: More commonly, moving papers are served by mail, postage prepaid, to the attorney’s office as shown on any document the attorney filed in the action. [See CCP §§ 1012, 1013(a)](a) [9:86a] First class mail? Although first class mail is normally used, nothing in the statute actually requires this (perhaps a legislative oversight).[9:86b] Reserved.(b) [9:86c] Mailing date noted on face: The papers served are normally accompanied by an unsigned copy of the declaration of service showing the date and place of mailing. Otherwise, the date and place of mailing should be noted on the face of the papers served (e.g., “Mailed at Los Angeles, California, April 15, 2017”). [CCP § 1013(b)]But this is “directory” only (see CCP § 1013(h)) so that no adverse consequence flows from failure to comply.(c) [9:86d] When service complete: Service by mail is effected upon deposit of the papers in a post office, mailbox or similar facility maintained by the U.S. Postal Service. [CCP § 1013(a)]Although service is complete upon deposit, the notice period is extended by 5 calendar days for papers mailed in California to an address within California, and for longer periods if either the service is on the California Secretary of State’s address confidentiality program, or the place of mailing or place of address is outside California. [CCP § 1005(b); see ¶ 9:87.1]1) [9:86e] Compare—CCP § 1013: The extension periods provided in CCP § 1013 do not apply to motion papers. [CCP § 1005(b); see further discussion at ¶ 9:87.4]2) [9:86f] Establishing date of service: A formal proof of service (¶ 9:86.1) is the most common way to establish the date of service by mail. But it is not the only method: “On the contrary, it is sufficient proof of mailing if the [paper served] … bears a notation of the date and place of mailing [CCP § 1013(b)].” [Berg v. Darden (2004) 120 CA4th 721, 733, 15 CR3d 829, 838](d) [9:86.1] Proof of service: Proof of service is made by a declaration of mailing. [See Preis v. American Indemnity Co. (1990) 220 CA3d 752, 758-759, 269 CR 617, 621—postal receipt filled out by post office employee is hearsay and shows only that an envelope was mailed, not its contents]The form of the declaration depends on whether the declarant personally deposited the document in the mail:1) [9:86.2] By person depositing in mail: The declaration must state the declarant’s residence or business address (in the county where mailing occurs); that the declarant is over the age of 18 and not a party to the action; the name and address of the person served; that the envelope was sealed and deposited in the mail, postage prepaid; and the date and place of deposit in the mail. [CCP § 1013a(1); see Katelaris v. County of Orange (2001) 92 CA4th 1211, 1215, 112 CR2d 556, 559; American Contractors Indemnity Co. v. County of Orange (2005) 130 CA4th 579, 583, 29 CR3d 916, 919 (citing text)]a) [9:86.2a] Place of deposit: Listing the city and state satisfies § 1013a; the precise location of the mailbox is not required.

Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).2) [9:86.3] By person familiar with business practice for mailing: Frequently, the secretary or other person doing the mailing declaration does not actually put the mail in the U.S. mailbox, but gives it to someone in the office for this purpose. In such cases, the declarant must state (in addition to the above, ¶ 9:86.2) familiarity with the office’s practice for depositing mail, that correspondence would be deposited in the mail on the same day, and that the document served was placed for deposit in accordance with the office practice. [CCP § 1013a(3); see Katelaris v. County of Orange, supra, 92 CA4th at 1215, 112 CR2d at 559—upholding declaration stating “to the best of my knowledge” declarant followed regular procedure for collecting, processing and depositing mail on date in question]a) [9:86.3a] Presumption of valid service: Such declarations are sufficient to raise a rebuttable presumption that the notice has been received in the ordinary course of mail. [Ev.C. § 641; Bonzer v. City of Huntington Park (1993) 20 CA4th 1474, 1479, 25 CR2d 278, 280—presumption dispelled by declarations denying receipt]b) [9:86.3b] Service presumed invalid if postmark delayed: Service is presumed invalid if there is more than a one-day difference between the postmark or postage meter date and the date of service shown on the proof of service. [CCP § 1013a(3)]However, the presumption is rebuttable, affecting the burden of producing evidence; the party seeking to invoke the presumption must file a motion to obtain its benefit. [CCP § 1013a(3); Simplon Ballpark, LLC v. Scull (2015) 235 CA4th 660, 668, 185 CR3d 482, 488]Compare: This presumption applies only where the person signs the proof of service based on “business practice” rather than personal knowledge. No such presumption applies where the affidavit of mailing is based on personal knowledge. [Tobin v. Oris (1992) 3 CA4th 814, 826, 4 CR2d 736, 743 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 90 CR2d 260)—nor does it apply where service has been admitted]c) [9:86.3c] Not applicable to overnight delivery: A declaration by someone familiar with the business practice for collecting and processing mail does not apply to service by overnight delivery. [Humane Soc. of United States v. Sup.Ct. (Regents of Univ. of Calif.) (2013) 214 CA4th 1233, 1249-1251, 155 CR3d 93, 106-108; and see ¶ 9:86.8 for proofs of service by overnight delivery]FORMS• Proof of Service by First-Class Mail—Civil (optional Judicial Council form POS-030).• Proof of Service—Civil (optional Judicial Council form POS-040).• Proof of Service by Mail (Business Practice to Entrust Deposit to Others), see Form 9A:11 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:86.4] Reserved.(e) [9:86.5] Sufficiency of address: A proof of service is sufficient if it shows mailing to the attorney’s office address “last given … on any document” filed in the action. [CCP § 1013(a)]If the attorney moves while the action is pending, it is the attorney’s duty to file and serve a notice of change of address. [CRC 2.200]1) [9:86.6] Street address alone sufficient: A declaration of mailing is sufficient if it shows the correct street address of the attorney’s office building—even if the floor or suite number is omitted. The street address alone is deemed “substantial compliance” with CCP § 1013. [Jackson v. Bank of America (1983) 141 CA3d 55, 58, 190 CR 78, 80]2) [9:86.6a] Mail sent to former address: Mail sent to a former address is deemed properly served for up to one year after the change of address because postal regulations require the U.S. Postal Service to forward first class mail at no charge during that period. [See Lee v. Placer Title Co. (1994) 28 CA4th 503, 509-510, 33 CR2d 572, 575-576]But mail sent to a former address more than a year after a change of address is not properly served because postal regulations require such mail to be returned to the sender. [Lee v. Placer Title Co., supra, 28 CA4th at 510, 33 CR2d at 576]3) [9:86.6b] Wrong zip code: Service is invalid if the wrong zip code is used unless the serving party can prove that the document was actually received. [Moghaddam v. Bone (2006) 142 CA4th 283, 288, 47 CR3d 602, 606; see also Rodriguez v. Henard (2009) 174 CA4th 529, 537, 94 CR3d 313, 318—wrong zip code on mailing affidavit for application for entry of default (see CCP § 587) was not prejudicial and was not ground for setting aside default](3) [9:86.7] Service by overnight delivery service: Papers may also be served by Express Mail (U.S. Postal Service) or “another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery” (e.g., Federal Express). [CCP § 1013(c)](a) [9:86.7a] Method of service noted on papers served: The papers served are normally accompanied by an unsigned copy of the declaration of service (¶ 9:86.8 ff.). Otherwise, the date and place of deposit should be noted on the face of the papers served (e.g., “Deposited with U.S. Postal Service for Express Mail at Los Angeles, California, April 15, 2017”). [CCP § 1013(d)]However, this is “directory” only (see CCP § 1013(h)) so no adverse consequence flows from failure to comply.(b) [9:86.7b] When service complete: Service is complete at the time the papers are deposited with the overnight carrier. Proof of receipt is not required. [CCP § 1013(c); see Barefield v. Washington Mutual Bank (2006) 136 CA4th 299, 302, 38 CR3d 858, 860—service complete when papers deposited with Federal Express for overnight delivery, although papers were returned to sender after 4 unsuccessful attempts at delivery; compare Blaich v. West Hollywood Rent Stabilization Dept. (2011) 195 CA4th 1171, 1177, 125 CR3d 317, 321—where statute required administrative record to be “personally delivered or mailed,” overnight delivery did not constitute “mail,” so service was not considered complete until record was delivered, not earlier at time of deposit with overnight carrier](c) [9:86.8] Proof of service: A declaration is required stating:• [9:86.8a] For service by Express Mail, that the papers were deposited:— in a sealed envelope (Express Mail postage prepaid);— in a post office or mailbox regularly maintained by the U.S. Postal Service for Express mail service;— addressed to the address last shown by that person on any document filed in the action by the person to be served (or to the person’s residence). [CCP § 1013(c)]• [9:86.8b] For service by “another method of delivery providing for overnight delivery” (e.g., Federal Express), that the papers were deposited:— in an envelope or package designated by the express service carrier;— in a facility regularly maintained by the express service carrier or delivered to a courier or driver authorized to receive documents on its behalf;— with delivery fees paid or provided for;— addressed to the address last shown by that person on any document filed in the action (or to the person’s residence).

Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:86.9] Reserved.(4) [9:86.10] Service by fax: Service by fax is permitted only where the parties have agreed to this method of service and a written confirmation to that effect is made. [CCP § 1013(e)]The Judicial Council has adopted rules to implement such service (CRC 2.306). Service by fax is ineffective if the transmission does not “fully conform” to these rules. [CRC 2.306(h)(5)][9:86.11] Reserved.➪ [9:86.12] PRACTICE POINTER: The main reason to agree to fax service is to speed up service of papers on other parties. Whether this is an advantage or disadvantage is a tactical decision in each case.Note, however, that where there are more than two parties, if any of them refuses to agree, mail service will still be required as to that party.(a) [9:86.13] Signature not required: The statute and CRC rule require only a “written confirmation” of the agreement. No signature is apparently required. Therefore, a letter from one counsel to the other confirming the agreement for fax service presumably will suffice.(b) [9:86.14] Court may utilize parties’ agreement for fax service: Where the parties have agreed to fax service, the court may serve notices upon the parties by fax. [CRC 2.306(c)][9:86.15] Reserved.(c) Duties of parties agreeing to fax service1) [9:86.16] Service lists: The plaintiff (or petitioner named first in the petition) must maintain a current list of the parties that includes their fax numbers for service and, on request, must furnish a copy of that list to any other party or the court. [CRC 2.306(b)(1)]A copy of this list must be served on each new party who has not yet appeared in the action, contemporaneously with service of the order, notice, or pleading served on the new party. [CRC 2.306(b)(2)(B)]On first appearing in the action, each party agreeing to fax service must furnish the plaintiff or petitioner named first in the complaint or petition with its fax number for service. [CRC 2.306(b)(2)(A)][9:86.16a - 9:86.16d] Reserved.2) [9:86.16e] Fax machine available for reception: A party or attorney who has agreed to fax service (¶ 9:86.16) must make that person’s fax machine “generally available for receipt of served documents” from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on days other than court holidays. [CRC 2.306(f)]➪ [9:86.16f] PRACTICE POINTER: Disputes may arise where one lawyer claims the other attorney’s fax line is always busy or is out of paper. If fax service is crucial, call the attorney (or the attorney’s assistant) on another line to verify the fax machine is operating; and if it is, ask them to schedule a time for reception. (Their refusal to do so could facilitate your obtaining an order shortening time for service by other methods.) Especially for voluminous papers, consider service by means other than fax, such as the far more convenient and popular electronic service, if agreed to by the parties or otherwise authorized (see ¶ 9:86.25).(d) [9:86.17] When fax service complete: Fax service is complete when the entire document is received by the receiving party’s fax machine. If any part of the document is received after 5 p.m., the document is deemed served the next court day. [CRC 2.306(g)](e) [9:86.18] Method of service noted on papers served: The papers served are normally accompanied by an unsigned copy of the proof of service (¶ 9:86.19). Otherwise, the date and place of fax transmission should be noted on the face of the papers served (e.g., “Served by facsimile transmission from Los Angeles, California on April 15, 2017, to fax number (…)”. [CCP § 1013(f)]But this is “directory” only (see CCP § 1013(h)), meaning no adverse consequence flows from failure to comply.(f) [9:86.19] Proof of service: Proof of fax service may be made on the same declaration form as service by mail (CCP § 1013a), modified to reflect service by fax instead of by mail. [CRC 2.306(h)]1) [9:86.20] Recipient’s fax number required: Fax service “shall” be to the fax machine telephone number of the person to be served as last given by that person on any document filed in the action and served on the party making the fax service.

[CRC 2.305(a)]➪ [9:86.22] PRACTICE POINTER: It is not necessary for the signature to appear on the copy transmitted. An unsigned copy can be transmitted with “/s/ (signer’s name)” to indicate the original bears that person’s signature.1) [9:86.23] Procedure to obtain production of original: Opposing parties may at any time serve a demand for production of the original signed document; and the parties shall then arrange a meeting for this purpose.

[See, e.g., S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.11; L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.4]2) [9:86.30a] Mandatory filing by local rule or court order: Upon adopting a local rule permitting the electronic filing of documents (see ¶ 9:86.30), the court may adopt a rule requiring electronic filing in civil actions and may order electronic filing in any class action, consolidated action (or group of separate actions), coordinated action, or “complex” action, absent “undue hardship or significant prejudice” to any party.

If the court acts sua sponte to require electronic service and/or filing, it must first mail notice to the parties and give them 10 days within which to serve and file any opposition (e.g., claiming undue hardship or prejudice).

A document emailed directly may be rejected by spam filters in use by a recipient’s email service provider. Similarly, a lengthy motion for summary judgment with multiple attachments may trigger a 10 MB file size restriction in use by many email security systems. If that happens, you may be completely unaware that a pleading has been served on you, and the sender may not know the document was rejected.Stipulating to use of an electronic filing service provider eliminates the risk of matters not being served or documents not being delivered. The electronic filing service provider also maintains a docket of all pleadings that have been served in the case that can conveniently be downloaded. Alternatively, if the parties decide to email directly, they may want to stipulate to acceptable file sizes to ensure that documents that are larger than a specified number of MB will be broken into separate, smaller documents and sent via separate emails. It is helpful to identify in the body of the email the names of the files to ensure the recipient is aware of each file being transmitted.(e) [9:86.37] Electronic notification as alternative to electronic transmission: As an alternative to electronic transmission of a document, electronic service may also be effected by electronic notification of where a document may be viewed and downloaded, with a hyperlink to that location. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(1)(C); CRC 2.250(b)(4)]➪ [9:86.38] PRACTICE POINTER: This is useful in complex, multi-party cases where the parties have by agreement created a website onto which all pleadings, depositions and discovery documents are downloaded. Motion and opposition papers may then include a hyperlink to retrieve voluminous documents from that website. This avoids the necessity of attaching them as an electronic file (that may be impractical for voluminous documents).1) [9:86.39] Party’s responsibilities: The party using electronic notification must preserve the document served and maintain the hyperlink until the case is settled or judgment is final. [See CRC 2.251(h)]Compare—parties out of case: When a party is no longer in the case, that party may give notice to all other parties that the hyperlink to documents will be maintained for 60 days and is then relieved of the obligation to maintain the hyperlink thereafter. [CRC 2.251(h)(3)(B)](f) [9:86.40] When service complete: Electronic service is complete at the time of transmission or electronic notification of service. If an electronic filing service provider is used, service is complete at the time the provider electronically transmits the document or sends electronic notification of service. Any document that is served between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day is deemed served that court day. Any document served on a noncourt day is deemed served on the next court day. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(4); CRC 2.251(i)]1) [9:86.41] Extension following electronic service: Except as noted below (¶ 9:86.42), any period of notice or any right or duty to act or respond within a specified period to a document served electronically is extended by 2 court days. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B)]a) [9:86.42] Exceptions: The above extension of time (¶ 9:86.41) does not apply if a statute or court rule provides otherwise; and the extension expressly does not apply to a notice of intent to move for new trial or to vacate the judgment; or a notice of appeal. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(3)(B)]Nor does the extension of the filing period apply to a remittitur. [Wash v. Banda-Wash (2025) 108 CA5th 561, 565-566, 573, 329 CR3d 529, 530-531, 536—remittitur is not served on parties but merely sent to them][9:86.43 - 9:86.44] Reserved.(g) [9:86.45] Proof of electronic service: Proof of electronic service may be made in essentially the same manner as provided for service of papers by mail (CCP § 1013a), except that the declaration of service does not need to state that the person making the service is not a party to the action, and must state:— the electronic service address of the person making the service in addition to that person’s residence or business address;— the date of the electronic service;— the name and electronic service address of the person served; and— that the document was served electronically. [CCP § 1013b(a), (b); CRC 2.251(j)(1)]Motion papers: Proof of electronic service of a moving party’s papers must be filed with the court at least 5 court days before the hearing.

Before Trial FORMS (TRG).1) [9:86.46] Electronic filing: The proof of electronic service may be in electronic form and may be filed electronically with the court. [CCP § 1013b(d); CRC 2.251(j)(1)]2) [9:86.47] Custody of proof of service: If a person signs a printed form of a proof of electronic service, the party filing must maintain the printed form of the document bearing the declarant’s original signature and must make it available for review and copying upon request by the court or any party. [CRC 2.251(j)(3), 2.257(b)(2)][9:86.48 - 9:86.49] Reserved.(h) [9:86.50] Changes of address: The court must maintain and make available to the parties electronically a list of the electronic service addresses provided by the parties. [CRC 2.251(e)]However, each party is obligated to notify the court promptly of any change in the party’s electronic service address, and to serve this notice electronically on all other parties in the case. Until such notice is filed and served, service directed to the address on file with the court is presumed valid. [CRC 2.251(c)(4), (g)]FORM: Notice of Change of Electronic Service Address (optional Judicial Council form EFS-010), see Form 9A:14.4 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:86.51 - 9:86.59] Reserved.(6) [9:86.60] Civility Guidelines: The timing and manner of service of papers should not be used to the disadvantage of the party receiving the papers. For example:• An attorney should serve papers on the attorney who is responsible for the matter at the attorney’s principal place of work and, if possible, at a time agreed upon in advance;• An attorney should allow sufficient time for opposing counsel to prepare for a court appearance or to respond to the papers. An attorney should not serve papers to take advantage of an opponent’s absence or to inconvenience the opponent (e.g., by serving papers late on Friday afternoon or the day preceding a holiday);• When it is likely that service by mail will prejudice an opposing party, an attorney should serve the papers by other permissible means (e.g., overnight delivery or courier). [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 7]d. Length of notice required(1) [9:87] Papers served personally: If the moving papers are to be served personally, a motion can be noticed for hearing 16 court days or more after the papers are served and filed. [CCP § 1005(b)](There are a few exceptions; e.g., a motion for summary judgment must be served at least 75 days before the hearing; see ¶ 10:77.)(2) [9:87.1] Extension for service by mail: If motion papers are served by mail, the required 16 court days’ notice is increased as follows:— an additional 5 calendar (not court) days, if the papers are mailed in California to an address in California;— an additional 10 calendar days, if the place of mailing or address is in another state;— an additional 12 calendar days, if the place of address is the Secretary of State’s address confidentiality program; and— an additional 20 calendar days, if the place of mailing or address is in another country. [CCP § 1005(b)](3) [9:87.2] Extension for service by fax, express mail or overnight delivery: Where the notice is served by facsimile transmission, express mail or other method providing overnight delivery (e.g., Federal Express), the 16-court-days’ notice period is extended by 2 calendar (not court) days. [CCP § 1005(b) (3rd sent.)]The time for service and filing is computed by counting backwards 16 court days from the hearing date, excluding the day of the hearing, plus counting backward an additional 2 calendar days because of service by fax, express mail or overnight delivery. [CCP § 12c]Comment: If, by counting backwards, the 16th court day is a Monday, counting back an additional 2 calendar days would be a Saturday. Because CCP § 1005(b) requires motions to be served and filed “at least 16 court days before the hearing” (plus 2 additional days for service by fax, express mail or overnight delivery), the motion would have to be served and filed on the preceding Friday.Further comment: Although CRC 2.306(d) purports to extend the notice period by “two court days” where documents are served by fax, this appears to be invalid as to motions covered by CCP § 1005 because it is in direct conflict with CCP § 1005(b)’s “two calendar days” extension.(4) [9:87.2a] Extension for electronic service: Where email service is authorized (see ¶ 9:86.25), the 16-court-days’ notice period is extended by 2 court (not calendar) days. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(3); see ¶ 9:86.41]Exceptions: This extension does not apply to motions for new trial or to vacate a judgment under CCP § 663a or to a notice of appeal (see ¶ 9:86.42).(5) [9:87.3] Compare—certain motions governed by other notice periods: CCP § 1005(b) expressly does not apply where other notice periods are provided by law, including:— motions for summary judgment or summary adjudication (CCP § 437c(b)(6); see ¶ 10:77);— ex parte applications for determination of good faith settlement (CCP § 877.6(a)(2); see ¶ 12:841 ff.);— motions for new trial (CCP § 659);— motions to set aside and vacate judgment (CCP § 663a); and— remittiturs (Wash v. Banda-Wash (2025) 108 CA5th 561, 565-566, 573, 329 CR3d 529, 530-531, 536).(6) [9:87.4] Compare—extension for performance of other acts (CCP § 1013): CCP § 1013 extends the time in which a right may be exercised or an act performed following service of papers other than motion papers (see CCP § 1005(b) (4th sent.)). There is no difference when the service is by mail (i.e., 5 calendar days for service by mail within California to a California address; 10 calendar days, if mailed to or from another state; 12 calendar days, if mailed to the Secretary of State’s address confidentiality program; 20 calendar days, if mailed to or from another country), but CCP § 1013 differs from CCP § 1005(b) for service by fax, express mail or other method providing overnight delivery. Under CCP § 1013, the extension is for 2 court days (not calendar days as under CCP § 1005(b)). [CCP § 1013(c), (e)](a) [9:87.5] Extends time periods measured from date of service: Where a time period prescribed by statute or court rule is triggered by “service” of a document, § 1013(a) extends the time accordingly. For example:• date amended pleading due after notice of ruling on demurrer served by mail (CCP § 472b);• date responsive pleadings due after amended complaint served by mail (Lam v. Ngo (2001) 91 CA4th 832, 842, 111 CR2d 582, 589-590—anti-SLAPP motion (see ¶ 7:952));• date responses due to interrogatories served by mail;• deadline for acceptance of CCP § 998 settlement offer served by mail (Poster v. Southern Calif. Rapid Transit Dist. (1990) 52 C3d 266, 274, 276 CR 321, 325-326);• deadline for filing peremptory challenge to assignment of all-purpose judge where notice of assignment is mailed (California Business Council for Equal Opportunity v. Sup.Ct. (Wilson) (1997) 52 CA4th 1100, 1106, 62 CR2d 7, 10).(b) [9:87.6] Not applicable to time periods measured from other dates: On the other hand, CCP § 1013 does not apply where the prescribed time period is measured from date of filing, hearing, entry of order, etc. For example:• deadline for request for trial de novo after arbitration measured from filing of arbitration award (see ¶ 13:146);• deadline for action against governmental entities after order granting relief from claim filing requirement measured from filing of minute order (see ¶ 1:814);• deadline for court order granting new trial is measured from entry of judgment, and is not extended by mailed notice of entry. [Westrec Marina Mgmt., Inc. v. Jardine Ins. Brokers Orange County, Inc. (2000) 85 CA4th 1042, 1048, 102 CR2d 673, 675-676]e. [9:88] Defects waived by arguing merits at hearing: Insufficient or defective notice may be waived if opposing counsel shows up at the hearing and argues the merits of the motion. If they appear at all, they should limit their argument to objections based on the defective notice. Otherwise, the court will treat their opposition on the merits as a waiver of the defects. [Alliance Bank v. Murray (1984) 161 CA3d 1, 7, 207 CR 233, 237; Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 CA4th 690, 697, 91 CR2d 844, 848]To preserve the issue for appeal, the opposing party should expressly object to the defective notice in its opposition papers, request a continuance and demonstrate prejudice from the defective notice.

Judges may react negatively where the defective notice has not hampered preparation of a response.[9:88.2 - 9:88.4] Reserved.f. [9:88.5] Orders shortening time: Except in the case of summary judgment or adjudication motions (see ¶ 10:77), if the relief sought by the motion needs to be obtained earlier than the minimum statutory time for the making of the motion permits, counsel may apply to the court for an order shortening notice of the hearing.Such an application may be made ex parte, but the opposing party must be informed (usually by telephone) that such an application will be made. [CRC 3.1203; see detailed discussion at ¶ 9:351 ff.] 4. Filing Requirementsa. [9:89] Where filed: The moving papers must be filed in the office of the court clerk (not in the department where the matter is noticed for hearing) unless otherwise provided by local rule or court order. [CRC 3.1302(a)]➪ [9:89.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Some courts require courtesy copies (e.g., S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.7(B); Alameda Sup.Ct. Rule 3.30(c)) and many judges appreciate them. Also, courtesy copies ensure that the judge will receive all of your papers filed in connection with a motion. Generally courtesy copies are delivered directly to the department hearing the motion.➪ [9:89.2] FURTHER PRACTICE POINTER: Be sure the courtesy copies are printed in the same colors and tabbed in the same way as the original and that any highlighting color does not obscure the text. Consider, with the court’s permission, providing a USB device for voluminous briefs or exhibits. Do not fasten a stack of papers in a way that it is not readily accessible (e.g., binding a 10-inch high stack of papers at the top with an Acco clip). Make certain that all courtesy copies are in at least by the time of the reply. Consider lodging conformed copies of all moving, opposition and reply papers with the judge. And always check local rule requirements.b. [9:90] When filed: Moving papers must be filed at least 16 court days before the hearing date, unless an order shortening time is granted. [CCP § 1005(b); CRC 3.1300(a)]The latest a paper may be filed is at the close of business of the clerk’s office on the day the paper is due. (No slipping the papers under the door or fax-filing during evening hours.) [CRC 3.1300(e); see Rosenberg v. Sup.Ct. (Germino) (1994) 25 CA4th 897, 900, 30 CR2d 803, 805—after hours fax deemed filed following day]Exception for certain electronically-filed documents: The preceding rule does not apply if the document is filed electronically in a court that has adopted a local rule or court order providing for electronic filing of documents. Documents received between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day are deemed filed that day. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(3)]c. [9:90.1] Appearance and filing fees: If the notice of motion is the first paper filed by a party in an action, an appearance fee must accompany the moving papers. [See Gov.C. §§ 70611-70616 (uniform filing fees)]After the first paper has been filed, there is a fee for filing a motion, application or any other paper requiring a hearing. [See Gov.C. § 70617(a)](1) [9:90.1a] Effect of bounced check: If the appearance fee is paid by a check that is returned unpaid, the court clerk must notify the party involved to pay the fees within 20 days. If the hearing is scheduled within the 20-day period, the fee must be paid before the hearing; otherwise, the court must void the motion “and proceed as if it had not been filed.” [See CCP § 411.20(a), (e); Hu v. Silgan Containers Corp. (1999) 70 CA4th 1261, 1268, 83 CR2d 333, 337; see also ¶ 1:950 ff.]If the person who tendered the check was a nonparty (e.g., an attorney’s filing service), the clerk must also notify the party or party’s attorney. [CCP § 411.20(a)]d. [9:90.2] Filing by fax: Pursuant to legislative authority (CCP § 1010.5), the Judicial Council has adopted rules for filing papers with a court by fax transmission. [CRC 2.303, 2.304](1) [9:90.3] Which courts: Fax filing is permitted in any court through a third person (a “fax filing” agency; see ¶ 9:90.9).“Direct filing” is permissible only in courts which have adopted a local rule authorizing such filing (see ¶ 9:90.14). (Such rules are not preempted by CRC 3.20(a) because they are specifically authorized by CRC 2.304(a).)Local rules authorizing direct fax filing are in effect in several courts. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.22; ¶ 9:90.14](2) [9:90.4] Which papers: Except as noted below (¶ 9:90.5), any pleading, motion or other document permitted to be filed with the court may be fax-filed.(a) [9:90.5] Exceptions: No will, codicil, bond or undertaking may be filed by fax. [CRC 2.300(b)]Nor may the court issue by fax any document intended to carry the original seal of the court (e.g., writs, letters testamentary, etc.). [CRC 2.300(b)](b) [9:90.6] Exhibits: Exhibits larger than 8 1/2 x 11 inches must be reduced to that size before they are transmitted. [CRC 2.302]The court may in any case require the party to file the original of an exhibit filed by fax. [CRC 2.302](3) [9:90.7] Signatures on fax-filed documents: See discussion at ¶ 9:86.21.(4) [9:90.7a] Originals retained: Originals of documents filed by fax must be retained by counsel for production to the court and opposing parties as may be ordered by the court. [CRC 2.305(b), (c)](5) [9:90.8] Direct filing vs. fax filing agency: Two different methods of fax filing are authorized:(a) [9:90.9] Through fax filing agency: Unless local court rules authorize “direct fax filing” (see ¶ 9:90.14), papers to be filed must be faxed to a “fax filing agency.” (This refers to any person or company that assumes responsibility for receiving such transmissions and filing the papers with the court.) [CRC 2.303(a), 2.304(a); see also S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.7(C)]1) [9:90.10] Advance arrangements with fax filing agency required: A fax filing agency is not required to accept papers for filing unless “appropriate arrangements” have been made in advance for payment of applicable fees and service charges. Absent such arrangements, the agency may discard any papers transmitted to it for filing. [CRC 2.303(c)]2) [9:90.11] Duties of fax filing agency: Upon receipt of the fax transmission, the agency will:• Photocopy: Prepare the documents for filing with the court—i.e., by photocopying the fax onto 20-lb. paper as required by CRC 2.103. [CRC 2.303(b)]• File with court: Physically deliver and file the documents with the court and pay any applicable filing fee. [CRC 2.303(b)]The agency will also normally fax (or mail) to the sender a proof of filing; e.g., a file-stamped copy of the papers filed or a transmittal sheet showing this information. • Confidentiality: Keep confidential all documents transmitted to it except as provided by the Rules of Court. [CRC 2.303(d)]Note: By filing a document with the court, the fax filing agency certifies its compliance with the above rules and that the document filed is a full and complete copy of that received by fax. [CRC 2.303(e)]3) [9:90.12] Notation of fax filing on face of document: Each document to be fax-filed must contain the words “BY FAX” immediately below the title of the document (not at the end). [CRC 2.303(f)]It is the fax filing agency’s responsibility to make sure the document contains such notation (and to add it if it does not). [CRC 2.303(b)]4) [9:90.13] Responsibility for errors in transmission: The fax filing agency acts as agent of the filing party—not as agent of the court. [CRC 2.303(a)]Thus, any error in the fax transmission or filing is charged to the filing party. It cannot be cured by nunc pro tunc order as in courts with direct filing procedures (¶ 9:90.21).(b) [9:90.14] Direct fax filing (if authorized by local rules): Any court may, by local rule, allow direct fax filings in addition to accepting filings through fax filing agencies. [CRC 2.304(a)]The Los Angeles Superior Court allows direct fax filings in small claims and family law (as well as filings through a fax filing agency). The court’s fax machines are available 24 hours a day; but filings received after business hours are deemed filed the next court day. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.22]By General Order, electronic filing of all documents in the Los Angeles Superior Court is mandatory in all limited and unlimited civil cases except for self-represented litigants, parties who apply for and are granted an exemption, and certain exempt documents. Fax filing is not permitted for mandatory e-filed documents. [See Los Angeles Superior Court First Amended General Order re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (5/3/19), available on the court’s website (www.lacourt.org)]1) [9:90.15] Time of filing: The rule governing service by fax provides that fax transmissions after 5 p.m. are deemed served the next court day. [CRC 2.306(g); see ¶ 9:86.17]However, there is no comparable rule governing fax filing of documents. It is therefore up to each court to determine the hours during which it will accept fax filings. [Rosenberg v. Sup.Ct. (Germino) (1994) 25 CA4th 897, 900, 30 CR2d 803, 805—complaint transmitted at 10 p.m. on day before expiration of statute of limitations deemed filed following day because court clerk’s office closed at 5 p.m.]2) [9:90.16] Cover sheet mandatory: Every document to be fax filed directly with the court must be accompanied by a “Facsimile Transmission Cover Sheet” in the form approved by the Judicial Council. [CRC 2.304(b)]FORM: Facsimile Transmission Cover Sheet (Fax Filing) (mandatory Judicial Council form MC-005).a) [9:90.16a] Accompanying processing instructions: Processing instructions may be transmitted along with the Facsimile Transmission Cover Sheet. [See Fry v. Sup.Ct. (2013) 222 CA4th 475, 484, 166 CR3d 328, 333—CCP § 170.6 peremptory challenge fax-filed to central filing office that had no instructions as to whom it should be delivered was improper and ineffective because it did not comply with statutory requirement that peremptory challenge be “made to” challenged judge or presiding judge]➪ [9:90.16b] PRACTICE POINTER: If you want the document you are fax filing to be delivered to a particular location in the courthouse other than the central filing office, be sure to transmit processing instructions along with the Facsimile Transmission Cover Sheet.3) [9:90.17] Notation of fax filing on face of document: The requirements are the same as for filings through fax filing agencies (see ¶ 9:90.12).4) [9:90.18] Filing fees: In addition to any other required filing fee, courts are authorized to charge a “reasonable fee not to exceed costs” for direct fax filing. This fee is to be charged on a per page basis. [CRC 10.815(b)(14)]5) [9:90.19] Payment of filing fees: Filing fees are payable by credit cards, debit cards, electronic funds transfers or debit accounts. (Account numbers, expiration dates and signatures appear on the mandatory cover sheet.) [CRC 2.304(e)(1)]Charges rejected by the credit or debit card company are treated in the same manner as a returned check. [See CCP § 411.20; CRC 2.304(e)(2)]6) [9:90.20] No confirmation: There is no requirement that the court confirm a fax filing. (Even so, many courts fax or mail back a copy of the cover sheet to show the filing date and case number assigned.)In Los Angeles, counsel can arrange, upon payment of a fee, to have the court confirm receipt of fax filings. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.22(b)(4)]7) [9:90.21] Relief for errors in transmission or filing: The sender’s machine must print out a transmission record for each fax filing. If errors occur in transmission or in the court’s process of the filing, the sender can move for an order filing the document nunc pro tunc based on the transmission record and proof of transmission. [CRC 2.304(d)]8) [9:90.22] Retain documents: Originals of the documents transmitted by fax must be retained by counsel for production to the court or other parties, if so ordered. [CRC 2.305]e. [9:91] Electronic filing: “Electronic filing” is the transmission of a document to a court in electronic form. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(1)(D); CRC 2.250(b)(7)]Courts are authorized to adopt local rules permitting parties to file documents electronically in any civil action or proceeding (see ¶ 9:92). In addition, a court may order electronic filing of documents in certain types of cases (see ¶ 9:93); and may itself electronically file any notice, order, minute order, judgment or other document prepared by the court. [CRC 2.252(g)]As of July 1, 2025, in any action in which a party or other person is subject to mandatory electronic service or has consented to such service, the court shall electronically serve such party or person “any document issued by the court that the court is required to transmit, deliver, or serve.” [CCP § 1010.6(d) (amended eff. 7/18/24)]➪ [9:91.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Courts across the state are in various stages of development of their electronic filing systems so that court rules and orders are frequently changing. In whatever court you are practicing, you need to go to that court’s website to determine its specific efiling requirements.FORM: Order Re: Electronic Service [and Filing], see Form 9A:14.2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:92] When permitted: By local rule, a court may permit parties to file documents electronically in any action or proceeding, directly or through an approved electronic filing service provider, subject to the conditions in CCP § 1010.6 and CRC 2.250 et seq. [CRC 2.253(a)](a) [9:92.1] Format requirements: An electronically-filed document must be in the format specified by the court unless it cannot be created in that format. [See CRC 2.256(b)]The format adopted by the court must meet the following requirements:— the software for creating and reading the documents must be in the public domain or generally available at reasonable cost;— the printing of documents must not result in loss of text, format, or appearance; and— the document must be text searchable when technologically feasible without impairment of the document’s image. [CRC 2.256(b)](b) [9:92.2] When filing of original document required: In actions requiring the filing of an original document (e.g., the original promissory note in an action on the note), an electronic copy of the document may be filed, provided the original is filed within 10 calendar days. [CRC 2.252(e)](c) [9:92.2a] Efiling sealed documents: If you have a document you want to efile under seal, consult the court’s website. Some courts have adopted special procedures for electronic filing of sealed documents (see ¶ 9:416 ff.). For example, San Francisco Superior Court requires that a motion to file documents under seal be filed electronically along with redacted and unredacted (conditionally sealed) copies of the documents. Courtesy copies of the conditionally sealed documents must be lodged with the department where the motion will be heard (S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.11(C)(3)).In Los Angeles, the actual motion or application to submit documents conditionally under seal must be electronically filed, and a courtesy copy of the motion or application, along with the documents submitted conditionally under seal, must be delivered directly to the courtroom to which the case is assigned. If the court orders documents to be filed under seal, those documents must be filed electronically and designated sealed by the filer (First Amended General Order re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (5/3/19); www.lacourt.org).(d) [9:92.3] Filing through agents: Electronic filing may be permitted by the parties directly, by an agent, or through an electronic filing service provider. [CRC 2.250(b)(6), (8)](2) [9:93] When required: By local rule, a court may permit or require electronic filing as follows:Permissive filing: By local rule, a court may permit electronic filing of documents in any type of case. [CRC 2.253(a)]Mandatory filing: By local rule, those courts that have permitted electronic filing may require electronic filing in all civil actions or in specified categories of civil actions, such as:— cases of a specific category (e.g., limited or unlimited);— cases of a specific type (e.g., contract, personal injury, employment);— cases assigned to a judge for all purposes;— cases assigned to a particular department or courtroom;— class actions, consolidated actions, coordinated actions or actions classified as “complex” under Judicial Council Rules (see ¶ 12:47.1);— any combination of cases described above. [CCP § 1010.6(g); CRC 2.253(b)(1)]Or, if a court has adopted a local rule permitting e-filing, the court may order, on motion of a party or on its own motion, all represented parties to file documents electronically in the following types of cases:— class actions;— consolidated or coordinated actions;— “a group of actions”; or— “complex” actions. [CCP § 1010.6(f); CRC 2.253(c)(1)]Before entering such an order, the court must make a finding that the order would not “cause undue hardship or significant prejudice to any party.” [CCP § 1010.6(f)(1); CRC 2.253(c)]The order may require that the parties:— file all documents electronically; or— serve and file all documents electronically, except when personal service is required by statute or rule. [CRC 2.253(c)(1), (2)](a) [9:93a] Parties exempted: Self-represented parties are exempt from mandatory electronic filing and service requirements. When electronic service and filing are required (by local rule or court order), each self-represented party must be served with documents by nonelectronic means unless the self-represented party affirmatively consents to electronic service (see ¶ 9:86.26). [CRC 2.253(b)(2), (3)]In addition, a represented party must be excused from mandatory electronic filing and service if the party shows undue hardship or significant prejudice. A court requiring electronic filing and service must provide a process for parties to apply for relief from the requirement. [CRC 2.253(b)(4)](b) [9:93.1] Application: Details of the efiling programs listed below (¶ 9:93.2 ff.) can be found on the respective court’s websites and in local rules:• [9:93.2] Ventura County Superior Court permits electronic filing in all civil actions.• [9:93.3] The Santa Clara and Contra Costa County Superior Courts have ordered that all papers in complex civil cases be filed electronically unless specifically excused by court order.• [9:93.4] The Sacramento, San Bernardino and San Joaquin Superior Courts have adopted efiling programs for small claims division actions.(c) Mandatory efiling1) [9:93.5] Orange County: With limited exceptions, all documents filed in limited, unlimited and complex civil actions in Orange County must be filed electronically unless the court orders otherwise. [See Orange County Sup.Ct. Rule 352 and further details on court’s website (www.occourts.org)]2) [9:93.6] San Francisco: San Francisco Superior Court requires efiling and eservice for all civil cases except small claims actions. [See S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.11(A)(3), (C)]3) [9:93.7] Los Angeles: The Los Angeles Superior Court requires electronic filing in all limited, unlimited and complex civil cases. Electronic filing is permitted in small claims matters. (See the court’s website for details and general orders re electronic filing under the link to “File Your Case Online” on the homepage (www.lacourt.org).)[9:93.8 - 9:93.9] Reserved.(d) [9:93.10] Procedure: If the court proposes to order electronic filing on its own motion, it must mail notice to the parties who have not consented to electronic service and may e-serve parties who have consented, and allow them 10 days for any opposition. [See CRC 2.253(c)(3)]If a new party is later joined in the action, the court may either repeat the notice process or give the newly-joined party 10 days to object to electronic service and filing of documents. [CRC 2.253(c)(4)]1) [9:93.11] Resubmitting documents previously filed: The court may order that documents previously filed in paper form may be resubmitted electronically. [CRC 2.253(c)(5)(A)]2) [9:93.12] Confirmation of filing as service: The court may also order that when the court sends confirmation of an electronic filing to all parties, receipt of that confirmation constitutes service of the filed document if it is available electronically. [CRC 2.253(c)(5)(B)]3) [9:93.13] Compare—where electronic filing not feasible: When electronic filing has been ordered but it is not feasible to convert a document to electronic form by scanning, imaging or other means, the court may permit filing that document in paper form. [CRC 2.252(d)](3) [9:93.14] Filing fees: The court may authorize any method of payment for electronic filing of documents, including credit cards, debit cards, electronic fund transfers or debit accounts. [CRC 2.258(a)] (Eligible persons may seek a fee waiver; see CRC 2.258(b).)(4) [9:94] Effect of electronic filing: The following are some of the important effects of electronic filing:(a) [9:94.1] Same effect as paper filing: Filing a document electronically does not alter any filing deadline. [CRC 2.252(c)]1) [9:94.2] Compare—where filing of original document required: If the court requires the filing of an original document, the electronic filer may file an electronic copy of the document but must file the original within 10 calendar days. [CRC 2.252(e)][9:94.3] Reserved.(b) [9:94.4] Time of filing: A document received electronically by the court between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day is deemed filed on that court day. A document received on a noncourt day is deemed filed on the next court day. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(3)]1) [9:94.5] Effect of court’s technical problems: If a court’s technical problem prevents acceptance during regular filing hours, and an electronic filer demonstrates an attempt to file on that day, the document—other than a complaint or any other initial pleading—is deemed filed on that day. [CRC 2.259(c)]➪ [9:94.6] PRACTICE POINTER: You can’t blame breakdowns in the court’s electronic filing system for missing a statute of limitations deadline.[9:94.7 - 9:94.9] Reserved.(c) [9:94.10] Signatures: Unless a document is required to be filed “under penalty of perjury,” an electronically-filed copy is deemed signed by the party who filed it electronically if the filer is the signer or the person signed the document in accordance with the procedures set forth in the CRC. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(2)(A); CRC 2.257(c)(1)]When a document to be filed electronically provides for a signature under penalty of perjury, the document is deemed to have been signed by that person if filed electronically, provided that:• The declarant has signed the document using an electronic signature and declares under penalty of perjury under the laws of the state of California that the information is true and correct. If the declarant is not the electronic filer, the “electronic signature must be unique to the declarant, capable of verification, under the sole control of the declarant, and linked to data in such a manner that if the data are changed, the electronic signature is invalidated” (CRC 2.257(b)(1); CCP § 1010.6(e)(2)(B)(ii)); or• The declarant, before filing, has physically signed a printed form of the document. By filing it electronically, the filer certifies that the filer has the signed original and will make it available for inspection and copying upon request by the court or any party. [CRC 2.257(b)(2); CCP § 1010.6(e)(2)(B)(i)] (If such a request is made, the filer must make the original available for inspection and copying by all other parties within 5 days after the request is served; see CRC 2.257(b)(2)(B). Alternatively, the court may order it produced at a specified time and place; see CRC 2.257(b)(2)(C).)1) [9:94.11] Compare—documents requiring signatures of opposing parties: When a document to be filed electronically requires the signature of opposing parties (e.g., a stipulation), the party filing the document must obtain the signatures of all parties on a printed form. By filing electronically, the filer “indicates” that all parties have signed it, and the filer has the original in the filer’s possession and will make it available for inspection and copying (¶ 9:94.10), or the opposing party or other person signs using an electronic signature unique to that person that is capable of verification and under the person’s sole control. [CRC 2.257(c)]2) [9:94.12] Compare—judicial signatures: If the signature of a judicial officer is required on the electronically-filed document, it may be electronically signed “in any manner permitted by law.” [CRC 2.257(e)](5) [9:95] Confirmation of filing: The court must first send the filer a confirmation, indicating date and time of receipt. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(A); CRC 2.259(a)(1)]If the document complies with filing requirements and the required fees have been paid, the court will promptly send the filer confirmation that the document has been filed. The electronically-filed document is considered received at the date and time the confirmation of receipt is created. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(B); CRC 2.259(a)(1), (2)]➪ [9:95.1] PRACTICE POINTER: It is the filer’s responsibility to verify receipt and filing of the document. Absent a confirmation of receipt and filing from the court, there is no presumption that an electronically-filed document has been received and filed. [See CRC 2.259(a)(3), (4)](6) [9:95.2] Rejection of filing: If the document was rejected for filing, the court must send the filer notice to that effect, stating the reasons why the document was rejected for filing. If the filer was an electronic filing service provider or electronic filing manager, the electronic filing service provider or electronic filing manager must promptly send the notice of rejection to the party or person who submitted the document. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(C), (D); CRC 2.259(b)]If the rejected document is a complaint or cross-complaint, the statute of limitations is tolled for the period beginning on the date on which the court received the document through the later of either the date on which the clerk of court sent notice of the rejection or the date on which the electronic filing service provider or electronic filing manager sent notice of rejection, plus one additional day if the complaint or cross-complaint is subsequently submitted in a form that corrects the errors that caused the document to be rejected. [CCP § 1010.6(e)(4)(E)](7) [9:96] Electronic filer’s obligations: Electronic filers must:— comply with court requirements that are designed to ensure the integrity of the filing and to protect sensitive personal information;— furnish information the court may require to process the case;— take reasonable steps to ensure that the filing does not contain viruses or other computer code that may harm the electronic filing system of the court or other users of the system;— furnish electronic addresses in a manner specified by the court (if the filer has consented to or is required to accept electronic service);— immediately furnish the court and parties with any changes in the filer’s electronic address;— if using an electronic filing service provider, provide the service provider with the electronic address at which the filer is to be sent all documents and immediately notify the provider of any change in that address (CRC 2.256(a)); and— file documents in a format specified by the court (formatting requirements in other rules are superseded) unless the documents cannot be created in that format (CRC 2.256(b)).(a) [9:96.1] Change of electronic service address: A party or other person whose electronic notification address changes during a pending action or proceeding must promptly file a notice of change of address with the court electronically and serve this notice on all other parties and others required to be served. A party’s or other person’s election to contract with an electronic filing service provider does not relieve the party or other person of these obligations. [CRC 2.251(g)]Until the change of electronic notification address has been filed and served, service on the party at the party’s electronic address of record is presumed valid. [CRC 2.251(g)(3)](8) [9:97] Public access: An electronically-filed document is a public document at the time it is filed unless it is sealed (see ¶ 9:416 ff.) or otherwise made confidential by law. [CRC 2.254(c), 2.503(a)](a) [9:97.1] Courthouse electronic access: Electronic access to electronically-filed documents must be provided at the courthouse to the extent feasible (i.e., to the extent the court has the resources and technical capacity). [CRC 2.503(b)-(d)][9:98 - 9:99] Reserved.f. [9:100] Filing proof of service: Proof of service in compliance with CCP § 1005 (see ¶ 9:87) should accompany the moving papers. If filed separately, the proof of service must be filed at least 5 court days before the hearing. [CRC 3.1300(c); see ¶ 9:15.1]➪ [9:100.1] PRACTICE POINTER: File your proof of service with your moving papers whenever possible. It should be attached as the last page of the moving papers, where it can be easily found. Reason: The first thing the judge or law clerk working on the case will look for is this proof of service.(1) [9:100.2] Effect of failure to comply if opposition filed: If an opposition has been filed, the judge may overlook the moving party’s failure to file a proof of service (on the assumption that the moving papers must have been timely served).(A proof of service is particularly important in multiparty cases. The fact one party has filed an opposition does not prove timely service was made on other parties.)[9:100.3 - 9:100.4] Reserved.➪ [9:100.5] PRACTICE POINTER: When filing a proof of service separate from the moving papers, be sure to attach a cover sheet captioned “Proof of Service of (name of paper served).” Otherwise, there is an excellent chance it will be lost.Also, put the hearing date on the cover sheet because documents are often delivered to the department that will hear the matter based on the hearing date.g. [9:100.6] Clerk’s duty to accept filing: So long as a pleading presented for filing substantially complies with the CRC and appropriate fees are paid (or waived), the court clerk has a ministerial duty to file the pleading and has no discretion to refuse it.

(Montano) (2011) 201 CA4th 1285, 1287, 134 CR3d 381, 382—clerk had no authority to demand that moving party cite or quote precedent before motion would be filed] © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[9:110.1] Due process limitation?➪ PRACTICE POINTERS• [9:101] Determine whether opposition necessary: Do not assume that every time your opponent makes a motion you must oppose it. If the likelihood is that the motion will be granted, why make a trip to court to fight it? Even if the ruling might go either way, there nevertheless may be sufficient merit to the motion that you should stipulate to its being granted, thereby saving yourself a trip to court (and your client the cost).• [9:101.1] Save time by not opposing: If you represent plaintiff and have worked hard to draft the complaint, do not necessarily insist on fighting the demurrer. Keep in mind that parties are required to meet and confer on objections raised in demurrers (CCP § 430.41(a)), motions to strike (CCP § 435.5), and motions for judgment on the pleadings (CCP § 439). In most cases, if there is any apparent merit to the demurrer, you should agree to amend. The time spent in amending the complaint will be far less than the time required to draft an opposition and fight the demurrer in court.• [9:101.2] If opposition necessary, do it right: On the other hand, if you have a good faith basis to oppose the motion, make sure you file whatever declarations and points and authorities are necessary to defeat it. This is true even if the moving papers appear technically insufficient: The judge may disagree with your assessment and treat your failure to oppose as a waiver of any objection to the motion.Caution for moving party: If your opponent chooses not to file an opposition, you should not assume the motion will be granted. Even though the lack of a “written opposition may be construed by the court as an admission that the motion is meritorious, and the court may grant the motion without a hearing on the merits” (CRC 3.1342(b) (regarding motions to dismiss)), motions that are technically insufficient or lack substantive merit may be denied notwithstanding lack of opposition.• [9:101.3] Adhere to standards of professionalism: It is unprofessional to force opposing counsel to make a motion that you do not intend to oppose. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(h)(2)—“A lawyer should not force his or her adversary to make a motion and then not oppose it”]If your motion is unopposed, speak with opposing counsel to see whether counsel will stipulate, saving your client and the court from expending unnecessary time.• [9:101.4] Avoid sanctions: If you decide to oppose, limit your arguments to those well supported by the facts and the law. Under CCP § 128.7, presenting papers to the court creates a certificate of their legal and factual merit; and sanctions may be imposed for violation of this certificate (see ¶ 9:1135). In addition, a trial court could order sanctions under CCP § 128.5 for the filing of a frivolous opposition. [See CCP § 128.5(b)(1)—bad-faith “actions or tactics” include “the making or opposing of motions”; see ¶ 9:1010] 1. [9:102] Grounds for Opposition: There are three bases on which a motion may be opposed:a. [9:102.1] Procedural challenges: The moving party’s papers fail to comply with the procedural requirements applicable; e.g., insufficient notice, failure to serve all supporting documents, improper timing of motion, etc.➪ [9:102.2] PRACTICE POINTER: In such cases, opposing counsel could choose not to file any opposition and simply request a continuance at the hearing, making record as to the inadequate notice or defective service. But to avoid the risk of a continuance being denied, it is better practice to file the best opposition possible under the circumstances—i.e., pointing out the motion’s procedural defects, stating the basic points of the opposition, and explaining why a more complete opposition could not be filed. Counsel should then appear at the hearing, object to the hearing taking place, and request a continuance so that a proper response to the motion can be filed. [See Carlton v. Quint (2000) 77 CA4th 690, 697-698, 91 CR2d 844, 848; Robinson v. Woods (2008) 168 CA4th 1258, 1267, 86 CR3d 241, 248 (citing text)][9:102.3 - 9:102.4] Reserved.b. [9:102.5] Evidentiary objections: The motion is based on inadmissible evidence.(1) [9:102.6] Requirements: Evidentiary objections should be filed in a separate document (rather than as part of opposing points and authorities). The objections should state:— the language verbatim to which objection is made;— the page and line number and document where such language appears; and— the legal ground for objection with the same specificity as would be required at trial. [Schoendorf v. U.D. Registry, Inc. (2002) 97 CA4th 227, 240, 118 CR2d 313, 322, fn. 2 (citing text)]FORM: Objections to Evidence and Objections to Evidence (Alternative Format), see Forms 10:6 and 10:6.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(2) [9:102.7] Time for filing: It is good practice to file and serve such objections concurrently with the opposition papers. If the objecting party decides to wait until the hearing to raise the objections, it is important to have a court reporter present to make a record of the court’s ruling (clerk’s minutes may not be sufficient).(a) [9:102.8] Summary judgment motions: According to the CRC, “all written objections to evidence in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment … must be served and filed at the same time as the objecting party’s opposition or reply papers are served and filed.” [CRC 3.1354(a)]However, CCP § 437c also allows evidentiary objections to be made at the hearing on a summary judgment motion (see ¶ 10:210.2).(b) [9:102.9] Comment: CCP § 437c does not apply outside the summary judgment/adjudication context. Counsel should follow CRC 3.1354(a) on motion hearings generally because it permits the court to prepare for the hearing and provide meaningful tentative rulings.c. [9:102.10] Opposition “on the merits”: Here, the opposition goes to the legal sufficiency of the motion. The opposition may argue that the moving papers inaccurately state the substantive law; or, it may distinguish the authority cited in the moving papers and present other authority that supports a different legal conclusion. Alternatively, where the moving papers are based on a factual showing, the opposition may dispute the inferences drawn by the moving party from those facts; or, may dispute the facts shown by presenting admissible evidence of other relevant facts. 2. [9:103] Form and Content of Opposition Papers: The same requirements applicable to the moving papers apply to the declarations and points and authorities filed in opposition to the motion (see ¶ 9:19 ff.).➪ PRACTICE POINTERS• [9:103.1] Too often, counsel attack the moving party’s declarations simply by arguing that the facts are disputed in the pleadings, or by setting forth factual arguments in the memorandum. This is not sufficient. The court is likely to accept the moving party’s factual assertions as true unless you present admissible evidence to the contrary, and this usually means opposing declarations.• [9:103.2] It is generally good practice to structure your opposing points and authorities to respond to each point made in the moving papers in the same order that they appear. Start off with any inaccuracies in the moving party’s statement of the facts or the history of the litigation. (But again, you will need admissible evidence—i.e., declarations—to establish the contradictory facts.) Follow with each argument made in the moving papers, showing why it is not valid; make sure you respond to each point. Finally, add whatever other reasons for denial are shown in your own declarations or evidence.• [9:103.3] Be sure to file written objections to any inadmissible evidence offered by the moving party; and if the moving party is basing the motion on facts not before the court, be sure to point this out in your memorandum.FORM: Memorandum and Declaration in Opposition to Motion, see Form 9A:1.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:103.4 - 9:103.9] Reserved.a. [9:103.10] Form requirements: See ¶ 9:19 ff.b. [9:103.11] Sanctions requests: Where the party opposing the motion seeks sanctions against the moving party or counsel, adequate notice must be given. For sanctions under CCP § 128.7, a separate sanctions motion is required; see ¶ 9:1190 ff.[9:103.12] Reserved.c. [9:103.13] Proposed order: If the responding party wants to speed up entry of the order denying the motion, that party may prepare and submit a proposed order with the opposition papers. (This saves the time involved in preparing and serving a proposed order after the hearing; CRC 3.1312(a), see ¶ 9:294 ff.) 3. [9:104] Service and Filing Requirements—Opposition Papers: Papers opposing a motion must be served and filed at least 9 court days before the hearing, unless the court permits a shorter time. [CCP § 1005(b); CRC 3.1300(a)]A document received electronically by the court between 12:00 a.m. and 11:59:59 p.m. on a court day is deemed filed on that court day. A document received on a noncourt day is deemed filed on the next court day. [CCP § 1010(b)(3)]Exceptions:• Papers opposing a summary judgment motion must be served not less than 20 days before the hearing (CCP § 437c(b)(2) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see ¶ 10:217);• Opposition to a discovery motion in an unlawful detainer action may be made orally at the hearing or in a writing served and filed on the court day before the hearing by a method reasonably calculated to ensure delivery by the close of business on that day (CRC 3.1347);• A response to a petition to compel arbitration must be served and filed within 10 days after service of the petition, unless extended by an agreement in writing between the parties or by court order. [CCP § 1290.6; Correia v. NB Baker Electric, Inc. (2019) 32 CA5th 602, 612-613, 244 CR3d 177, 182; see ¶ 9:408.37a]a. [9:104.1] Where filed: Unless local rules provide otherwise, opposition papers are filed in the court clerk’s office (not in the courtroom where the matter will be heard). [CRC 3.1302(a)] (Because expressly authorized by CRC 3.1302(a), such local rules are not preempted by CRC 3.20(a).)But some courts have adopted local rules providing otherwise. For example, in Los Angeles Superior Court, opposition and reply papers must be electronically filed in civil matters, except for self-represented parties and parties who have obtained an exemption. In those cases, the documents must be filed at the filing window by 4:30 p.m. In small claims matters, electronic filing is permitted, but not required. But in small claims appeals, represented parties are required to electronically file. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.4; and ¶ 9:93.7]Courtesy copies may be required by local rules and individual judges, and are in any event good practice because the electronic filing system does not post the documents to the court’s computer system immediately and may take many days to make them available.b. [9:105] Time not extended because moving papers served by mail (or fax): CCP § 1013(a) generally extends the time to “respond” to papers served by mail (see ¶ 9:87.4). But this does not apply to papers opposing a motion served by mail. [CCP § 1005(b); see ¶ 9:87.4]Thus, the deadline for serving and filing opposition papers is measured backward from the date of hearing (9 court days, except on summary judgment or summary adjudication motions), regardless of whether the moving papers were served personally, or by mail, overnight delivery or fax. [See Blake v. Ecker (2001) 93 CA4th 728, 736, 113 CR2d 422, 428, fn. 6 (disapproved on other grounds by Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 C4th 1094, 1107, 29 CR3d 249, 260 (citing text))]Similarly, the deadline for serving and filing a reply to the opposition is measured backward from the date of the hearing by 5 court days.c. [9:105.1] Manner of service: All papers opposing a motion must be served by personal delivery, fax, electronically, express mail, or other means consistent with CCP §§ 1010-1013 (the service of notice statutes) and “reasonably calculated to ensure delivery … not later than the close of the next business day” after the papers are filed with the court. [CCP § 1005(c) (emphasis added)](1) [9:105.2] Ordinary mail? Arguably, service by ordinary mail is “reasonably calculated to ensure delivery not later than the close of the next business day” where the mail is addressed locally. But the matter is unclear because the statute specifically enumerates other methods. [Blake v. Ecker, supra, 93 CA4th at 736, 113 CR2d at 428, fn. 6 (citing text)]d. [9:105.3] Proof of service: A proof of service should accompany the opposition papers. If filed separately, it must be filed at least 5 court days before the hearing. [CRC 3.1300(c); see ¶ 9:100]e. [9:105.4] Discretion re late-filed papers: Papers submitted after the deadline must be accepted for filing. But the court, in its discretion, may refuse to consider these papers in ruling on the motion (in which event, the minutes or order must so state). [CRC 3.1300(d); Jack v. Ring LLC (2023) 91 CA5th 1186, 1210, 309 CR3d 130, 150—court properly refused to consider late-filed papers](1) [9:105.5] Comment: A court’s decision to disregard late-filed papers may not be exercised arbitrarily. [Kapitanski v. Von’s Grocery Co., Inc. (1983) 146 CA3d 29, 32-33, 193 CR 839, 841—court can summarily reject late-filed papers under local rules, but if it considers them at all, it must apply CCP § 473 standards, and it is an abuse of discretion to refuse relief if “excusable neglect” shown]However, one court has held that a court has discretion to consider late-filed papers even without a CCP § 473 showing. [Juarez v. Wash Depot Holdings, Inc. (2018) 24 CA5th 1197, 1202, 235 CR3d 250, 253—filing 2 days late with no showing of prejudice by other side supported court’s discretion in “view of the strong policy of the law favoring the disposition of cases on the merits”]If the court decides to consider late-filed papers, a continuance may be necessitated. [See Hobson v. Raychem Corp. (1999) 73 CA4th 614, 623, 86 CR2d 497, 503 (dictum) (disapproved on other grounds by Colmenares v. Braemar Country Club, Inc. (2003) 29 C4th 1019, 130 CR2d 662)][9:105.6 - 9:105.9] Reserved. 4. [9:105.10] Effect of Failure to File Opposition Papers: Many judges treat a party’s failure to file opposition papers as an admission that the motion is meritorious, and therefore refuse to hear oral argument from such party.The purpose is to prevent introduction of legal theories without notice to opposing counsel and the court. [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712]a. [9:105.11] Compare—motion untimely as a matter of law: However, failure to file opposition papers does not justify granting a motion that is untimely as a matter of law (e.g., a motion to compel further discovery under CCP § 2031.310(c) must be made within 45 days after responses filed). [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712; see ¶ 8:1491] 5. [9:106] Reply Papers—Rebutting the Opposition: The moving party may file reply papers (additional declarations or points and authorities in reply to the opposition papers).However, a reply in support of a summary judgment/adjudication motion may not include any new evidentiary matter, additional material facts, or separate statement that was not presented in the moving or opposing papers. [CCP § 437c(b)(4) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see ¶ 10:222, 10:222.3]A reply is subject to the requirements below (¶ 9:107 ff.):➪ [9:106.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Some lawyers file reply briefs routinely. But reply papers that merely repeat arguments contained in the moving papers serve no purpose and may irritate the judge. Therefore, limit any reply brief to arguments introduced in the opposing papers or to explaining why the opposing papers do not rebut the arguments made in the moving papers.It is a serious mistake to leave key arguments for the reply brief on the theory it will give you the last word with the court. The court is likely to refuse to consider new evidence or arguments first raised in reply papers, or it may grant the other side time for further briefing. [See Maleti v. Wickers (2022) 82 CA5th 181, 228, 298 CR3d 284, 324 (quoting text); Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 CA4th 1522, 1537-1538, 161 CR3d 700, 712—under general rule of motion practice, new evidence not permitted with reply papers and is only allowed in exceptional cases; Balboa Ins. Co. v. Aguirre (1983) 149 CA3d 1002, 1010, 197 CR 250, 254 (stating rule in context of appellate briefs); compare Alliant Ins. Services, Inc. v. Gaddy (2008) 159 CA4th 1292, 1307-1308, 72 CR3d 259, 272—court has discretion to accept new evidence in reply papers as long as opposing party given opportunity to respond; Jacobs v. Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage Co. (2017) 14 CA5th 438, 449-450, 221 CR3d 701, 710—failure to object or seek permission to file surreply may waive objection to new matter (evidence or argument) raised in reply; see also ¶ 7:122.9]FORM: Reply Memorandum and Declaration in Support of Motion, see Form 9A:1.2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).a. [9:107] Form requirements: See ¶ 9:19 ff.b. [9:108] Service and filing requirements: Reply papers must be served and filed at least 5 court days before the hearing date “[u]nless otherwise ordered or specifically provided by law.” [CCP § 1005(b)]However, a reply filed in support of a motion for summary judgment/adjudication must be filed 11 days before the hearing date. [CCP § 437c(b)(4) (amended eff. 1/1/25)]And the reply to an opposition to a discovery motion in an unlawful detainer action may be made orally at the hearing (or in writing, served and filed the court day before). [CRC 3.1347](1) [9:109] Manner of service: See ¶ 9:105.1.(a) [9:109a] Ordinary mail? See ¶ 9:105.2.➪ [9:109b] PRACTICE POINTER: There is always a risk that pleadings, particularly those filed near the hearing date, may not be delivered to the judge or uploaded to the database in a court that uses only electronic “files” in time to prepare for the hearing. Consider lodging courtesy copies with the judge hearing the motion. See ¶ 9:89.1.In fact, some courts require them. For example, courtesy copies are required in San Francisco (S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.7(b)). And in Los Angeles, when electronic filings are filed two days or fewer before the hearing, a courtesy copy must be provided to the court. [See Los Angeles Superior Court First Amended General Order re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (5/3/19), available on the court’s website (www.lacourt.org)]c. [9:109.1] Discretion re late-filed papers: The court, in its discretion, may refuse to consider late-filed papers in ruling on the motion. In such event, the court’s minutes or order must so indicate. [CRC 3.1300(d); see ¶ 9:105.4]➪ [9:110] PRACTICE POINTER: If you decide reply papers are necessary but cannot be filed on time, it is often better practice to contact opposing counsel and ask for a stipulation to continue the hearing. (If refused, the judge may grant such continuance, provided a timely request is made; see ¶ 9:116 ff.)Having the matter continued is generally safer than late filing of reply papers. It avoids the risk the judge will refuse to consider your papers or that you might have to fight an uphill battle at the hearing because the judge has made a tentative ruling on the basis of the opposition papers without full opportunity to consider your reply papers.d. [9:110.1] Due process limitation? In some cases, 5 court days may not be enough time to review and contest reply papers that raise new factual or legal issues. A continuance may be required in order to provide a “fair hearing.” [See Marriage of Hoffmeister (“Hoffmeister I”) (1984) 161 CA3d 1163, 1171, 208 CR 345, 350—spousal support order apparently based on financial statements served in conjunction with reply memorandum just before hearing][9:110.2 - 9:110.4] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

Prehearing Procedures➪ [9:110.5] PRACTICE POINTERS: Here are important things to do before any law and motion hearing:• Learn about the judge: If you are not familiar with the judge, find out whatever you can regarding the judge’s attitude toward law and motion arguments generally, and your type of motion in particular (see ¶ 9:13). If the hearing is important enough, sit through one of the judge’s calendars before your hearing date.• Check your filing and proof of service: The court may refuse to consider late-filed papers. If relief is necessary, ask for it before the hearing date (see ¶ 9:105.4). Bring a copy of your file-stamped documents (or proof of electronic filing, if a file-stamped copy is not available) to the hearing in the event your document has not made it into the court file and the judge needs to see proof that your pleading was filed.• Consider lodging a “bench book” in big cases: Where voluminous documents are involved, it is good practice to lodge a “bench book” (i.e., a looseleaf binder containing copies of all documents relating to the motion) a few days before the hearing. The judge will appreciate your saving the court the substantial amount of time required to go through the court file to locate the papers to be considered (see ¶ 9:24.2).• Check with court clerk to make sure case on calendar: Sometimes, slip-ups happen in getting a case on calendar or getting the file to the courtroom. Also, ask whether the assigned judge or someone else will be handling the calendar.• Check for tentative rulings: If the judge publishes tentatives, take them seriously and try to save yourself unnecessary trips to court (see ¶ 9:111 ff.). If you fail to abide by local rules regarding tentative rulings, you may be deemed to have submitted to the tentative ruling.• Check with opposing counsel: Make sure opposing counsel is ready to go so you won’t waste time preparing matters that are likely to be continued.• Check whether a court reporter will be provided: Many courts no longer provide court reporters for civil hearings; others have court reporters available only certain days each week. If you will need a transcript of the hearing (for appeal or other purposes), check the court’s website to determine whether a court reporter will be provided or, if not, how you may arrange for a reporter at your own expense. If a party has a fee waiver, check the court’s website for any procedures for indigent parties requesting reporters. [See CRC 2.956(b) (requiring trial courts to adopt and publish local policy re provision of court reporters); and further discussion at ¶ 9:171 ff.]• Decide whether to draft a proposed order in advance of the hearing. If nothing else, the exercise of drafting can help the author crystallize precisely what the motion is requesting (and aid the court, for the same reason).• Consider whether to appear in person or remotely by phone or videoconference (unless personal appearance at the hearing is required, ¶ 9:159, 9:162), evaluating the costs of travel, the importance of the motion and the fact that personal appearances can be more effective than telephonic ones (see ¶ 9:157.2).Many courts now permit or require remote video appearances via local rules. [See, e.g., Orange County Sup.Ct. Rule 375; Riverside Sup.Ct. Rule 3132; Santa Clara Sup.Ct. General Rule 9]For a discussion of statewide rules regarding the use of technology for remote appearances, see ¶ 9:157.3 ff.a. [9:110.6] Requesting accommodations for persons with disabilities: The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Civ.C. § 51 et seq. require courts to provide accommodations to persons with disabilities. The Judicial Council has adopted a process for handling requests for accommodations in order “to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal and full access to the judicial system.” [See CRC 1.100(b)]Each court must designate at least one person to be the court’s “ADA coordinator” to address requests for accommodations (see CRC 1.100(b)). An ex parte written request for an accommodation can be made to the court’s ADA coordinator on the Judicial Council form Disability Accommodation Request (optional Judicial Council form MC-410).• FORM: Disability Accommodation Request (Optional Judicial Council form MC-410), see Form 1:23 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).Requests for accommodations must be made no fewer than 5 court days before the hearing date but the court has discretion to waive this requirement (see CRC 1.100(c)(3)). Under CRC 1.100(c)(1), requests for an accommodation may be presented orally, or ex parte on a Judicial Council form or in another written format 5 court days before the accommodation is to go into effect. [Gropen v. Sup.Ct. (Shabrang) (2023) 89 CA5th 1068, 1078, 306 CR3d 673, 680-681]The accommodation could be something as simple as an assistive listening device for a person with hearing loss or something more complicated, such as changing the location of a trial or hearing because the scheduled venue is not accessible to persons using wheelchairs. The Judicial Council has developed a Q & A handout on CRC 1.100 that contains useful information; it is downloadable at the California courts website (www.courts.ca.gov). [See also Marriage of James M.C. & Christine J.C. (2008) 158 CA4th 1261, 1265, 70 CR3d 715, 716—denial of request for accommodations can only be made on grounds specified in CRC 1.100(f); Biscaro v. Stern (2010) 181 CA4th 702, 710, 104 CR3d 817, 823—trial court has mandatory duty to rule on request for accommodation]➪ [9:110.7] PRACTICE POINTER: Be sure to inquire of your client well in advance of the court hearing whether any parties or witnesses who intend to attend need accommodations due to disabilities. The courts are usually able to provide accommodations, but are often unable to do so on short notice.(1) [9:110.8] Challenging the request for accommodation: Where a party requests a continuance as an accommodation, opposing parties must be given notice and an opportunity to view any medical records or other documents on which the request is based. [Vesco v. Sup.Ct. (Newcomb) (2013) 221 CA4th 275, 280, 164 CR3d 341, 344 (re request for trial continuance, court may hold in camera hearing and take other steps to protect privacy)]b. [9:111] Tentative rulings: Judges in many courts prepare “tentative” rulings. Tentatives are available from different sources in different courts. These rulings indicate the way the judge is prepared to decide the matter based on the information before the court when the ruling was prepared. Also, the judge’s approach to issuing tentative rulings may impact oral argument (¶ 9:113 ff.). [See CRC 3.1308; Brown, Winfield & Canzoneri, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Great American Ins. Co.) (2010) 47 C4th 1233, 1245, 104 CR3d 145, 155 (citing text)]In some cases, the tentative ruling may in effect be the court order. E.g., where local rules require counsel who disagree with the tentative to notify the court and opposing counsel by a deadline, the failure to do so may put the tentative into effect: “When plaintiffs failed to act, the tentative ruling became the ruling of the court.” [M & R Properties v. Thomson (1992) 11 CA4th 899, 901, 14 CR2d 579, 580]Failure to know and abide by a court’s tentative ruling procedures—and those differ from county to county—may make it impossible to contest the tentative at a hearing.(1) [9:112] Announcement before hearing date: Many judges issue tentative rulings by posting a calendar note outside the courtroom on the day of the hearing or simply announcing it at the time of argument. [See CRC 3.1308(b)]However, some courts prefer to announce tentative rulings before the day of the hearing in order to deter unnecessary appearances. (Some courts post their tentative rulings on the Internet.) To do so, however, the court must adopt a local rule, binding on all judges of the court, for announcing tentative rulings. [CRC 3.1308(b), (c)](a) [9:113] Impact on oral argument? There are several procedures for tentative rulings:• [9:113.1] No oral argument unless party gives notice of intent to appear: Tentative rulings will be made available by telephone, or other method designated by the court, by 3:00 p.m. on the day before the hearing. Unless a party notifies the court and all parties by 4:00 p.m. that day, by telephone or other method designated by the court, stating its intent to appear, no oral argument will be permitted (unless the court has requested it) and the tentative automatically becomes the ruling. [CRC 3.1308(a)(1) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see Tellez v. Rich Voss Trucking, Inc. (2015) 240 CA4th 1052, 1060, 193 CR3d 403, 409, fn. 10]• [9:113.2] Right to oral argument unaffected: Alternatively, the court may make its tentative rulings at any specified time before the hearing. The parties need not give notice of intent to appear at the hearing. The tentative ruling does not become final until the hearing. [CRC 3.1308(a)(2)](b) [9:114] Local rule requirements: The court must adopt a local rule to follow one of the above procedures (¶ 9:113 ff.), and the local rule must specify the method for obtaining tentative rulings and the time by which the rulings will be available. [CRC 3.1308(c) (amended eff. 1/1/25)]Adoption of a local rule pertaining to tentative rulings does not require the judge to issue such rulings. [CRC 3.1308(e)](c) [9:114a] Compare—no local rule adopted: If one of the above procedures (¶ 9:113 ff.) is not adopted by local rule, tentative rulings may be posted as a calendar note or by announcing the tentative ruling at the time of oral argument. [CRC 3.1308(b)]➪ [9:114.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Some courts have telephone equipment that allows counsel to call in and listen to a recording of the tentative rulings for matters on the calendar. The recording sometimes provides only abbreviated versions of the ruling (e.g., “granted” or “denied”), in which event a call to the clerk or trip to the courthouse may still be required.[9:114.2 - 9:114.4] Reserved.(2) [9:114.5] Generally, no dismissal of case or withdrawal of motion as tactic to avoid adverse tentative ruling: Parties are ordinarily expected to argue against a tentative ruling if they want to avoid it. They cannot, instead, after learning of the tentative but before it becomes final, dismiss the action without prejudice or withdraw the motion in an effort to escape the adverse ruling and start all over again. Such conduct, which “smacks of gamesmanship,” is not permitted. [See Cowan v. Krayzman (2011) 196 CA4th 907, 917-919, 126 CR3d 793, 801-803—at least regarding a case-dispositive hearing, D not entitled to withdraw first motion to vacate default after court issued tentative ruling denying motion in order to file second version of same motion; Fillmore Center Associates, LP v. Lewis (2024) 108 CA5th Supp. 68, 73, 329 CR3d 472, 476—P may not dismiss action without prejudice after adverse tentative summary judgment ruling announced; Groth Bros. Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Gallagher (2002) 97 CA4th 60, 72, 118 CR2d 405, 414—P not entitled to dismiss without prejudice after court posted adverse tentative ruling; and ¶ 11:25.2 ff.](a) [9:114.6] Comment: The court in Cowan (¶ 9:114.5) also noted that “[u]nder some circumstances it may be proper for a party to withdraw a motion after the trial court has issued an adverse tentative ruling, but before the ruling becomes final.” The Cowan court did not, however, elaborate on what those circumstances might be. [See Cowan v. Krayzman, supra, 196 CA4th at 919, 126 CR3d at 803 (emphasis added)]c. [9:115] Prehearing telephone calls by counsel: Although it can be difficult to get through to a busy law and motion department, some lawyers check with the court clerk and opposing counsel before the hearing to ensure the motion has been correctly calendared, especially if the court does not issue tentative rulings.d. [9:116] Continuances: If counsel agree to continue a matter, the judge will usually order a continuance without any appearance by counsel provided the conditions below (¶ 9:116.1 ff.) are complied with.(1) [9:116.1] Procedure to obtain: Some courts will grant a continuance on counsel’s oral representation that counsel has spoken to opposing counsel and that opposing counsel has agreed to the continuance request.In other courts, a law and motion matter may be continued (in the court’s discretion) by the moving party by telephoning the court at least 5 court days before the hearing, or by written stipulation of the parties filed at least 5 court days before the hearing. In either case, the moving party must serve written notice of the continued date on the other parties.Still other courts require a written stipulation or ex parte application for a continuance, either of which must be based on a declaration establishing good cause.(2) [9:117] Notice to court clerk: Regardless of which party is requesting the continuance, it is the moving party’s duty to notify the court “immediately” if the matter will not be heard on the scheduled date. [CRC 3.1304(b)](3) [9:118] Effect of prior continuances: In some courts, only two continuances will be granted based on agreement between counsel; thereafter, a court appearance is required and “good cause” must be shown in writing.(4) [9:119] Court’s discretion: By statute, the court “shall” postpone the hearing of any motion or demurrer (or trial) for up to 30 days “when all attorneys of record … agree in writing to such postponement.” [CCP § 595.2]Despite this language, the statute is held to be “directory, not mandatory” and does not entitle parties to a continuance as a matter of right. [Pham v. Nguyen (1997) 54 CA4th 11, 15, 62 CR2d 422, 424]Rather, the granting of a continuance is within the court’s sound discretion. Thus, the court has the power to deny a continuance and rule on a pending motion, or to order it off calendar—even if counsel have agreed otherwise.This is particularly true of stipulations to continue hearings on summary judgment motions within 30 days of trial, because CCP § 437c(a)(3) requires “good cause” for such a continuance (see ¶ 10:71 ff.).(a) [9:119a] Judicial policy: “Of course continuances should not be used as a dilatory tactic, and of course good cause … should be present … But … [t]he law should also encourage professional courtesy between opposing counsel … When opposing counsel needs a continuance [and no substantive right is impacted thereby], courts should look to section 595.2 as a statement of policy in favor of professional courtesy, not churlishness.” [Pham v. Nguyen, supra, 54 CA4th at 17, 62 CR2d at 425 (emphasis in original)](b) [9:119.1] When denial abuse of discretion: Under certain circumstances, denial of a continuance may be treated as an abuse of discretion. [Lerma v. County of Orange (2004) 120 CA4th 709, 714, 15 CR3d 609, 612]• [9:119.2] It was an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance to a lawyer who had been seriously ill and had only two days after leaving the hospital to prepare opposition to a motion for summary judgment. [Lerma v. County of Orange, supra, 120 CA4th at 712, 15 CR3d at 610]• [9:119.3] It was an abuse of discretion to deny a trial continuance where the lawyer was engaged in trial in another court. [Oliveros v. County of Los Angeles (2004) 120 CA4th 1389, 1399, 16 CR3d 638, 646][9:119.4 - 9:119.9] Reserved.➪ [9:119.10] PRACTICE POINTER RE STIPULATIONS: If you are relying on a stipulation for a continuance, make sure that your stipulation has been filed with and accepted by the court before the date set for hearing. Otherwise, you may find out later that your continuance was unexpectedly denied and adverse consequences have resulted (e.g., motion for summary judgment granted for lack of opposition).➪ [9:119.11] FURTHER PRACTICE POINTER: If you are relying on a court clerk’s statement that a hearing has been continued, get a copy of the order before the hearing date: “Reliance solely on a clerk’s advice regarding a continuance of a motion without ensuring that an order exists attesting to the continuance might well be reckless on the part of an experienced practitioner.” [Matter of Doran (Rev.Dept. 1998) 3 Cal. State Bar Ct.Rptr. 871, 877](5) [9:120] Sanctions for failure to notify clerk: Failing to timely advise the court clerk the hearing will not proceed as scheduled (for any reason) may be treated as a violation of court rules, punishable by money sanctions against counsel pursuant to CCP § 575.2 (see ¶ 9:1275).➪ [9:120a] PRACTICE POINTER: Keep in mind that the judge (or the judge’s clerk) typically reviews the file at least one or two days before the scheduled hearing. Therefore, quite apart from the risk of sanctions, it is extremely discourteous to the court for counsel to call in on the morning of the hearing and request a continuance. This not only puts the judge to a lot of wasted effort, but it causes a stream of additional paperwork for the court clerk (new minutes are needed, new calendar entries, etc.).e. [9:120.1] Stipulation “off calendar”: If the parties notify the court before the hearing that they have stipulated to the matter going off calendar, the court will generally so order. Some courts require a written stipulation or an ex parte application supported by a declaration showing good cause.➪ [9:120.2] PRACTICE POINTER: Notify the clerk in the department where the matter is noticed for hearing well in advance of the hearing. Again, last-minute notice is discourteous to the judge who may have already “worked up” the file in preparation for the hearing. You must inform the court immediately if the case settles. [CRC 3.1385(a)(1); see also CRC 3.650—duty to notify court and others of stay]FORM: Notice of Settlement of Entire Case (mandatory Judicial Council form CM-200), see Form 12B:9 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:120.3] Effect of stipulation that demurrer go off calendar: Under certain circumstances, a stipulation that a demurrer go “off calendar” may be treated as the “functional equivalent” of an order sustaining the demurrer. See discussion at ¶ 7:123.1 ff.(2) [9:120.4] Discovery responses received after motion to compel filed: The moving party should notify the court immediately if responses to discovery requests are received after a motion to compel such responses have been filed, as that may affect the nature of the motion proceedings. The court should be advised of any issues that still must be resolved (e.g., sanction requests), so that it can work up those issues and ignore the others raised by the motion.[9:120.5 - 9:120.9] Reserved.f. [9:120.10] Stipulation to commissioner hearing motion: “On stipulation of the parties litigant the court may order a cause to be tried by a temporary judge who is a member of the State Bar…” Any member of the State Bar may be agreed to by the parties. [Cal.Const. Art. VI, § 21; see Walker v. San Francisco Housing Auth. (2002) 100 CA4th 685, 691, 122 CR2d 758, 763—provision applies to pretrial motion hearings]The presiding judge of a court may appoint an attorney with at least ten years’ experience (or, for good cause, with at least five years’ experience) to serve as a temporary judge. [CRC 2.812(a)](1) [9:120.11] Failure to object as stipulation? Under some local rules, the parties are deemed to stipulate that designated matters (e.g., case management conferences) “may be heard by a temporary judge, by failing to file an objection in writing within thirty (30) days after the first pleading is filed in the action by that party.” [S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.3(A) (emphasis added); see also S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 10.0(B)—by failing to appear at hearing on discovery motion, parties deemed to stipulate that motion may be decided by temporary judge with same authority as superior court judge; but see also Michaels v. Turk (2015) 239 CA4th 1411, 1416, 191 CR3d 669, 672—although local rule provides for implied stipulation in certain matters, self-represented parties must be asked on record if they so stipulate]Cases are split on whether failure to object may constitute a stipulation.

[9:120.20] Court-ordered reference by commissioner or referee: Even absent a stipulation by the parties, the court may appoint a court commissioner or another person, not usually employed by the court, as referee to hear and decide certain issues. See discussion at ¶ 8:1803 ff. re procedures relating to referees.(1) [9:120.21] Issues subject to reference: The court may order a reference in the following cases:• When examination of a long account is necessary to resolve an issue of fact. [CCP § 639(a)(1)]• When it is necessary for the information of the court to take an account, before judgment can be entered or in order to carry a judgment or order into effect. [CCP § 639(a)(2)]• When a question of fact arises upon a motion or otherwise that involves the resolution of an issue outside the pleadings.

[9:121] Peremptory Challenges to Judge (CCP § 170.6): Parties may disqualify a judge by filing an affidavit (usually a declaration) known as a “peremptory challenge” in any hearing involving a “contested issue of law or fact.” [CCP § 170.6(a)(1); see Maas v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2016) 1 C5th 962, 973, 209 CR3d 571, 575—statute liberally construed in favor of challenges, which should be denied “only if the statute absolutely forbids it”][9:121.1 - 9:121.4] Reserved.a.

Form LACIV 015 satisfies requirements of both motion and affidavit]The statute prescribes the form of the affidavit substantially as follows:“… (name) being duly sworn, deposes and says: That he or she is a party (or attorney for a party) to the within action … That (name) the judge, court commissioner, or referee before whom … a hearing in the action … is pending … is prejudiced against the party (or the party’s attorney) or the interest of the party (or the party’s attorney) so that affiant cannot or believes that he or she cannot have a fair and impartial trial or hearing before the judge, court commissioner, or referee.” [CCP § 170.6(a)(6)] Comment: The Code also permits an oral statement of substantially the same content under oath (see CCP § 170.6(a)(7)).FORM: Peremptory Challenge to Judge, see Form 9A:9 in Rivera, Cal.

[9:121.20] Disqualification effective upon acceptance by court: If the affidavit is timely and in proper form, the challenged judge is disqualified “instantly and irrevocably.” But the peremptory challenge only takes effect when the court determines that the motion is timely and properly made.

(Clauson) (1999) 72 CA4th 140, 143-144, 84 CR2d 771, 773]Comment: The parties’ consent is required for a commissioner or referee to decide most motions, and therefore a § 170.6 challenge is unnecessary. But there are some matters on which a commissioner may act without the parties’ consent (see CCP §§ 259, 482.060, 516.040 and 639). In those situations, the § 170.6 challenge is the only method to disqualify a commissioner or referee, except for cause.➪ [9:122.3] PRACTICE POINTER: Keep in mind that only one challenge per side is allowed in civil cases (CCP § 170.6(a)(4)). Thus, it rarely makes sense to waste your challenge in law and motion proceedings unless the judge has been assigned for all purposes (see ¶ 9:128 ff.).The only situation which might justify using your challenge may be hearings on dispositive motions: i.e., motions for summary judgment or dismissal, or other motions that may be dispositive in a practical sense (e.g., for preliminary injunction, or to expunge lis pendens).(However, in direct calendar assignments, it is probably too late to challenge the judge; see ¶ 9:128.)➪ [9:122.4] PRACTICE POINTER: If you decide to challenge the judge and still want the matter calendared, let the court clerk know in advance of the hearing. This may facilitate assignment of the case to another judge on the same hearing date. Otherwise, a continuance is inevitable. In some courts, like the Los Angeles Superior Court, the standard order transferring the case to another judge vacates all pending hearing dates.g.

Otherwise, the master calendar exception does not apply, and a CCP § 170.6 challenge made before commencement of trial (rather than upon assignment) is timely. [Entente Design, Inc. v. Sup.Ct.

(Los Angeles County) (2007) 149 CA4th 1489, 1493, 57 CR3d 910, 913][9:127.2 - 9:127.4] Reserved.(f) [9:127.5] Challenge by later-joined parties: A party appearing after a case has been assigned to a judge for all purposes has the right to exercise a peremptory challenge within 15 days after appearing in the case. [CCP § 170.6(a)(2)]“Appearance in the case” has been interpreted to mean a “general appearance.” “An appearance is general if it is for any purpose other than to question the court’s jurisdiction,” and the fact parties refer to themselves as “specially appearing” is not determinative.

[CCP § 170.6(a)(2); Grant v. Sup.Ct. (Jacobs), supra, 90 CA4th at 526, 108 CR2d at 829-830](3) [9:130] Judge’s identity otherwise known (“10-day/5-day rule”): Where no all-purpose assignment has been made, but the identity of the judge who is to conduct the trial or hearing is known at least 10 days before the date set for trial or hearing, any peremptory challenge must be made at least 5 days before that date. [CCP § 170.6; People v. Sup.Ct. (Lavi), supra, 4 C4th at 1180, 17 CR2d at 823](4) [9:131] Continued proceedings: A peremptory challenge cannot be entertained as to subsequent hearings that are a part or continuation of the original proceedings. Moreover, a new lawsuit may be treated as continuation of a prior action if “it involves substantially the same issues and matters necessarily relevant and material to the issues involved in the [original] action.” [Bravo v. Sup.Ct. (County of Los Angeles) (2007) 149 CA4th 1489, 1493-1494, 57 CR3d 910, 913 (internal quotes omitted; brackets in original)— new complaint alleging facts occurring after prior action dismissed was not a “continuation of an earlier action,” so plaintiff could peremptorily challenge judge who presided over earlier action; National Fin’l Lending, LLC v.

Braley (2020) 52 CA5th 680, 687-688, 266 CR3d 502, 507-508—post-conviction resentencing was “continuation” of trial, so disqualification of judge in underlying criminal proceeding barred same judge from hearing post-conviction petition](a) [9:131.1] Effect of different parties in second suit: The continuation rule applies only when the second action involves “the same parties at a later stage of their litigation with each other, or … arise[s] out of conduct in or orders made during the earlier proceeding.” [NutraGenetics, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Cavenah) (2009) 179 CA4th 243, 257-258, 101 CR3d 657, 667-668 (emphasis in original); Pickett v. Sup.Ct. (99¢ Only Stores) (2012) 203 CA4th 887, 893-895, 138 CR3d 36, 40-42]It is not enough that the second action relates to the same incidents or events as the first action so that it is a “related case” for case assignment purposes (¶ 12:38 ff.) or that it involves a similar party litigating similar claims. If different parties or different causes of action are involved, the later suit is not a “continuation” of an earlier-filed suit for peremptory challenge purposes. [NutraGenetics, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Cavenah), supra, 179 CA4th at 257-258, 101 CR3d at 667-668 (different defendants); Pickett v. Sup.Ct. (99¢ Only Stores), supra, 203 CA4th at 893, 138 CR3d at 40 (different plaintiffs)—continuation rule inapplicable unless “gravamen” of second action is “rooted in or supplementary to the initial proceeding”](b) [9:131.2] Effect of disqualification in related but not consolidated cases: If cases have been deemed “related” but not consolidated for case management purposes (¶ 12:38 ff.), a valid § 170.6 challenge in one case does not require disqualification in the other. [Rothstein v. Sup.Ct. (Rothstein) (2016) 3 CA5th 424, 428, 207 CR3d 616, 619—challenge filed in civil case related to, but not consolidated with, earlier-filed case, in which assigned judge had resolved a disputed factual merits issue, only required transfer of later-filed case to another judge](5) [9:132] Special rule in cases coordinated for trial: “Complex” cases pending in different counties involving common issues may be coordinated for trial and a single judge assigned (CCP § 404 et seq.; see ¶ 12:370). Any CCP § 170.6 challenge to the assigned judge must be made “within 20 days after service” of the coordination order. [CRC 3.516 (emphasis added); see ¶ 12:380.1 ff.]A party must file a peremptory challenge within 20 days of either the assignment of the coordination motion judge or the assignment of the coordination trial judge, but cannot challenge both. [Prescription Opioid Cases (2020) 57 CA5th 1039, 1050, 272 CR3d 99, 105; see ¶ 12:380.3](a) [9:133] Extended for service by mail: Because the time limit runs from “service,” the time for challenge is extended under CCP § 1013 where the service is by mail (e.g., an additional 5 days if the address and place of mailing are within California). [Citicorp North America, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (KF Dairies, Inc.) (1989) 213 CA3d 563, 571, 261 CR 668, 674]Compare: The extension is only 2 court days where notice is served by express mail, fax or electronically. [CCP §§ 1013, 1010.6(a)(3); see ¶ 9:87.4 ff.](b) [9:134] Effect of prior ruling by judge: A peremptory challenge within 20 days after service of the coordination order is timely even if contested issues common to the coordinated cases had been decided by that judge before coordination. The coordination order provides a new time window for § 170.6 challenges. [Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Sup.Ct. (Abutal) (1992) 10 CA4th 1509, 1511, 13 CR2d 449, 450](c) [9:134.1] Effect of precoordination challenge: A party’s exercise of a peremptory challenge before the case was coordinated does not affect that side’s right to a second peremptory challenge to the coordination judge. [Philip Morris Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (U.A. Local 467) (1999) 71 CA4th 116, 123, 83 CR2d 671, 676-677; see ¶ 12:380.2](d) [9:134.2] Cases added on to coordinated proceeding subject to same 20-day limitation: The coordination trial judge has authority to determine that similar cases should be added on to the coordinated proceeding (CRC 3.544). A party or counsel in an “add-on case” is precluded from filing a peremptory challenge once the 20-day period has run following initial assignment of the coordinated proceeding to the coordination trial judge. [See CRC 3.532(d), 3.516; Industrial Indemnity Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Arnold) (1989) 214 CA3d 259, 263, 262 CR 544, 546—parties in cases added on 2 years after coordination denied opportunity to file peremptory challenge (decided under former CRC Rule renumbered as CRC 3.516)][9:134.3 - 9:134.4] Reserved.(6) [9:134.5] Untimely challenge does not exhaust right to challenge different judge: An untimely challenge may be stricken but does not affect the challenging party’s right to peremptorily challenge a different judge to whom the case is later assigned. [Truck Ins. Exchange v. Sup.Ct. (Park Northridge Homeowners Ass’n) (1998) 67 CA4th 142, 148, 78 CR2d 721, 724—untimely challenge to Judge X, who later retired, did not bar challenge to Judge Y to whom case was later assigned](7) [9:134.6] One-judge court deadline: CCP § 170.6(a)(2) provides that, if the court in which the action is pending is authorized to have no more than one judge, the § 170.6 challenge must be made within 30 days of the party’s first appearance in the action; that does not apply to “branches” or “divisions” of a court to which only one judge is assigned. However, the Legislature has now authorized at least two judges for every county, so there are no remaining counties for which there is only one authorized judge. [See Jones v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2016) 246 CA4th 390, 400-402, 200 CR3d 776, 782-783—one-judge deadline does not apply where six authorized judges for Superior Court even though only one judge assigned to branch court]Cross-refer: Timeliness of peremptory challenges is discussed further in Wegner, Fairbank, Wegner, Wegner & Chernow, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Trials & Evidence (TRG), Ch. 3.h. [9:135] Effect of judge having presided at prior hearing: If the § 170.6 challenge is timely, the fact the judge presided at an earlier hearing in the case does not prevent disqualification, unless the earlier hearing involved “contested fact issues relating to the merits” of the case. [CCP § 170.6(a)(2); see Depper v. Sup.Ct. (People) (1999) 74 CA4th 15, 21-22, 87 CR2d 563, 569]Allowing a challenge after the judge has ruled on contested fact issues relating to the merits would make it possible for litigants to gamble on obtaining a favorable decision and then disqualify the judge if confronted with an adverse ruling. The policy against judge-shopping precludes such a result. [See Stephens v. Sup.Ct. (Stephens) (2002) 96 CA4th 54, 60, 116 CR2d 616, 621](1) [9:136] Hearings NOT involving “contested fact issues relating to merits”: Most pretrial motions are decided without determining contested facts related to the merits of the case, so that the judge hearing the motion remains subject to a CCP § 170.6 challenge.

(Farmers Group) (1987) 196 CA3d 774, 786, 242 CR 148, 155—“This hearing was the last in a long series of proceedings … which bore on the merits of the case”](b) [9:137.2] Pretrial motion to exclude evidence: Where a judge had ruled on a pretrial motion to exclude evidence, a § 170.6 challenge was untimely.

Katz (1968) 68 C2d 512, 528, 67 CR 761, 771 (not involving CCP § 170.6)—ruling does not adjudicate merits because preliminary injunction merely preserves status quo; see also Guardado v. Sup.Ct.

(McClintock) (1987) 189 CA3d 267, 271, 234 CR 413, 415-416]However, a number of cases reject this “make or break” test as contrary to § 170.6(a)(2), which provides that only prior rulings on “contested fact issues relating to the merits” preclude a later § 170.6 challenge. Rulings on summary judgment motions involve legal issues, not contested fact issues. [School Dist. of Okaloosa County v. Sup.Ct.

(2001) 86 CA4th 1309, 1322, 104 CR2d 173, 182]➪ [9:138] PRACTICE POINTER: Even if a CCP § 170.6 challenge is available, it rarely makes sense to waste your challenge on a judge hearing law and motion matters—even one who has ruled against you on a prior demurrer or motion. The judge to whom the matter is assigned may be reluctant to rule differently from the judge whom you have disqualified. And it may be more important to use your § 170.6 challenge for the trial.i. [9:139] Only one challenge per side: Only one CCP § 170.6 challenge may be made by each party or side (if there is more than one plaintiff or defendant) in any one action or proceeding. [CCP § 170.6(a)(4)] (Different rules apply where coparties have substantially adverse interests; see ¶ 9:141.2.)Thus, a CCP § 170.6 challenge by one of several coparties bars any later § 170.6 challenge to the new judge by any of the other coparties, including coparties joined after the initial § 170.6 challenge. [School Dist. of Okaloosa County v. Sup.Ct. (City of Orange) (1997) 58 CA4th 1126, 1135, 68 CR2d 612, 617 (citing text)]The same rule applies where the party who exercised the challenge is later dismissed from the action. The remaining parties on the same side are not entitled to a new peremptory challenge. [See Home Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Montrose Chemical Corp.)

This addresses the concern that a judge whose ruling has been reversed might be biased against the party who successfully appealed that ruling.

However, an unsuccessful respondent is limited by CCP § 170.6(a)(4) to one peremptory challenge for the entire litigation. [Pfeiffer Venice Properties v. Sup.Ct.

[9:142] Disqualification irrevocable: Once an affidavit is filed under § 170.6 and accepted by the court, the judge is instantaneously and irrevocably disqualified (except for limited purposes specified in CCP § 170.4(a); see ¶ 9:121.20).k. [9:143] Dealing with adverse rulings: A litigant whose CCP § 170.6 challenge is denied must either seek reconsideration by the same judge (subject to stringent limitations, see ¶ 9:324 ff.); or promptly seek a writ of mandamus from an appellate court.(1) [9:144] Recourse to another judge? There is an apparent split of authority whether the validity of the challenge can be raised again before another trial judge, at least when the first judge is still on the bench.• One case holds that the matter cannot be raised before another judge. [See Micro/Vest Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Computerland Corp.) (1984) 150 CA3d 1085, 1090, 198 CR 404, 406]• But another case holds that a second judge can reconsider the matter if the original judge is no longer on the court or is otherwise “unavailable”—including when the “unavailability” is the result of the original judge’s recusal. [See Geddes v. Sup.Ct. (Campbell) (2005) 126 CA4th 417, 426, 23 CR3d 857, 863—after first judge erroneously disqualified himself, he was “unavailable,” so second judge could reconsider and rescind order disqualifying first judge; see also ¶ 9:324.4](2) [9:145] Appellate review: Appellate review may be sought by petition for writ of mandate filed and served within 10 days after service of written notice of entry of the court’s order determining the disqualification issue. Where notice of entry is served by mail, the time is extended as provided by CCP § 1013(a). [CCP § 170.3(d); see D.M. v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2011) 196 CA4th 879, 885-886, 126 CR3d 785, 790; Carl v.

Guide: Civil Appeals & Writs (TRG), Ch. 15.➪ [9:146] PRACTICE POINTER: The 10-day period to file a mandate petition runs from notice of the court’s decision (which may be immediate if the challenge is denied in open court). Therefore, you generally will not have time to file and have heard a CCP § 1008 motion for reconsideration (even if grounds exist; see ¶ 9:324).[9:147] Reserved. 3. [9:148] Challenging the Judge for Cause (CCP § 170.3): Pretrial challenges for cause are rarely encountered where a judge is assigned to a case only for a law and motion hearing. Such challenges are more likely to be encountered where the case is assigned to a judge for all purposes, including trial.The grounds and procedure for such disqualification are set forth in CCP §§ 170.1 and 170.3. [See Vallejo v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2021) 73 CA5th 132, 150, 288 CR3d 150, 163-164 (outlining procedure); and ¶ 9:148.1 ff. (briefly summarizing grounds and procedure)]Cross-refer: Challenges for cause are discussed in greater detail in Wegner, Fairbank, Wegner, Wegner & Chernow, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Trials & Evidence (TRG), Ch. 3.a. [9:148.1] Grounds for disqualification: Judges must disqualify themselves under the following circumstances:• Judge has personal knowledge of evidentiary facts at issue before the court. [CCP § 170.1(a)(1)]• Judge served as a lawyer in the proceeding or in another proceeding involving the same issues and parties or gave advice to any party to the proceeding relating to the proceeding. [CCP § 170.1(a)(2)]• Judge has a financial interest in the subject matter of the proceeding or in any of the parties to the proceeding. [CCP § 170.1(a)(3); see Chaganti v. Sup.Ct. (Cricket Communications, Inc.) (2021) 73 CA5th 237, 247, 288 CR3d 238, 245—“financial interest” incudes stock in corporate parent of party (matter of first impression)]• Close relative or spouse of the judge is a party or an officer, director or trustee of a party. [CCP § 170.1(a)(4)]• A lawyer or the spouse of a lawyer in the proceeding is the spouse, former spouse, child, sibling or parent of either the judge or the judge’s spouse, or if one of these relatives is associated in private practice with the lawyer in the proceeding. [CCP § 170.1(a)(5)]• Judge believes the recusal would serve the interests of justice, judge doubts the judge’s ability to be impartial, or “[a] person aware of the facts” might reasonably entertain doubts about the judge’s impartiality. [CCP § 170.1(a)(6)]• Judge has a physical impairment that interferes with the judge’s ability to conduct the proceeding. [CCP § 170.1(a)(7)]• The matter before the judge involves ADR (alternative dispute resolution) and the judge has discussed prospective employment with an ADR provider within the past two years. [See CCP § 170.1(a)(8)]• Judge has received a campaign contribution in excess of $1,500 within the last 6 years from a party or lawyer in the matter before the court. [CCP § 170.1(a)(9)(A)] (Smaller contributions must be disclosed; see CCP § 170.1(a)(9)(C).)Comment: CCP § 170.1(a) contains detailed definitions of the terms used and paraphrased above. Consult the statute carefully before proceeding.[9:148.2 - 9:148.4] Reserved.b. [9:148.5] Procedure if judge refuses recusal: If a judge is disqualified under CCP § 170.1 but refuses to recuse, the party seeking disqualification must file a verified written statement objecting to the judge and stating the facts that provide the basis for disqualification. The statement must be personally served on the judge, or on the judge’s clerk provided the judge is present in the courthouse. [CCP § 170.3(c)(1)]Copies of the statement must be served on all parties. [CCP § 170.3(c)(1)]FORM: Verified Statement Objecting to Hearing Before Judge—Disqualification for Cause, see Form 9A:28 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:148.6] Timing of statement: The statement of disqualification must be filed “at the earliest practicable opportunity after discovery of the facts constituting the ground for disqualification.” [CCP § 170.3(c)(1) (emphasis added); see Coble v. Ventura County Health Care Agency (2021) 73 CA5th 417, 423-424, 288 CR3d 431, 436—disqualification claim forfeited because party did not object when trial judge disclosed her prior employment at beginning of hearing; Tri Counties Bank v.

[Alhusainy v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2006) 143 CA4th 385, 394, 48 CR3d 914, 920](2) [9:148.7] Effect of filing statement of disqualification: Once a party files a statement of disqualification, the judge has no power to act in the case until the question of the judge’s disqualification has been determined. [CCP § 170.4(d); Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors (2020) 45 CA5th 348, 353, 258 CR3d 658, 662](3) [9:148.8] Effect after trial or hearing commences: But if the “statement of disqualification is filed after a trial or hearing has commenced by the start of voir dire, by the swearing of the first witness or by the submission of a motion for decision,” the trial or hearing may proceed if the judge so directs. [CCP § 170.4(c)(1)]However, if the judge is later found disqualified, the judge’s rulings will be automatically vacated. [CCP § 170.4(c)(1)][9:148.9] Reserved.c. [9:148.10] Judge’s response: Within 10 days of the filing or service of the statement, whichever is later, the judge may either consent to the disqualification or file a verified answer to the statement. The clerk must serve a copy of the answer upon the parties. Failure to file an answer is deemed a consent to the disqualification. [CCP § 170.3(c)(3), (4)]If the judge determines that the statement was untimely filed or if, on its face, it discloses no legal grounds for disqualification, the judge may order the statement stricken. [CCP § 170.4(b); see PBA, LLC v. KPOD, Ltd. (2003) 112 CA4th 965, 971, 5 CR3d 532, 535; Crawford v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

[9:148.15] Hearing on judge’s disqualification: Within 5 days, all the parties may agree on another judge to decide the issue of disqualification (although as a practical matter, this rarely happens). If the parties fail to agree, a judge is appointed by the Chief Justice. (Normally, the Chief Justice will appoint a judge from another county to hear the matter.) [CCP § 170.3(c)(5)]The decision of the hearing judge is not appealable and may only be reviewed by the appellate court on a petition for writ of mandate filed within 10 days of notice of the decision. [CCP § 170.3(d); Dumas v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors, supra, 45 CA5th at 354, 258 CR3d at 663]Comment: CCP § 170.3(d) provides that the question of disqualification may only be reviewed by a petition for writ of mandate to the appropriate court of appeal. Presumably, the appropriate court of appeal is the district that reviews decisions of the judge who heard the disqualification motion, but there is no known authority directly on point.[9:148.16 - 9:148.19] Reserved.e.

[9:148.21] Actions by disqualified judge after disqualification: Notwithstanding disqualification, a judge may take the following limited actions in the case after disqualification:• Issue orders necessary to maintain the court’s jurisdiction pending reassignment to a judge not disqualified;• Request another judge who has been agreed to by the parties to take over the case;• Hear and determine default matters;• Issue orders for possession prior to judgment in eminent domain proceedings;• Schedule a trial or hearing date;• Conduct a settlement conference. [CCP § 170.4; see In re Steiner, Decision and Order Imposing Censure (Calif. Comm’n on Judicial Performance 9/2/14, available online at http://cjp.ca.gov)—disqualified judge may not reassign case to another judge without parties’ agreement] 4. Procedures at Law and Motion Hearinga. Calendar call(1) [9:149] Check-in procedures: Counsel should check in with the bailiff, court attendant or clerk prior to the hearing.➪ [9:149.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: Plan to arrive in the department where the motion will be heard at least 15 minutes early.Upon arrival, check the hearing calendar (usually posted outside the courtroom) for the calendar number of the case on which you are appearing and for any tentative rulings by the court. Then check in with the bailiff, court attendant or clerk by stating the calendar number and the party for whom you are appearing; also provide your business card (two cards if there is a court reporter).If your client is present, take time to explain the proceedings and any tentative ruling by the court.(2) [9:150] Priority requests: Judges differ in the manner in which they handle their law and motion calendars. Many ask for priority requests at the outset. Others insist that priority requests be channeled through the court clerk before the hearing; the court clerk will advise the judge. (Call the court clerk the day before the hearing and find out how to proceed.)(a) [9:151] Judicial comment: Priority requests will generally be granted only when counsel is engaged in trial. The fact that a lawyer has a deposition scheduled back at the office at 10:00 a.m. is not a sufficient reason for priority, because practically every lawyer in the courtroom has other appointments as well.Although priority occasionally will be given to an attorney having an appearance in another courtroom, such double-settings are discouraged.(3) [9:152] Shorter matters: After noting priority requests, some judges simply proceed through their calendars “by the numbers,” from first to last. Many, however, take time estimates at the original calendar call, and hear the shorter matters first, saving those requiring longer argument for the end of the calendar. Still others take first uncontested matters where the tentative ruling favors appearing counsel, so that the majority of the lawyers may leave the courtroom quickly after the initial calendar call.(4) [9:153] Parties fail to appear: It is the moving party’s responsibility to notify the court immediately if a matter will not be heard on the scheduled date. [CRC 3.1304(b)](a) [9:153.1] Submitting without appearance: Either party may notify the court that the party will not appear at the hearing and submit the matter for decision, unless the court orders otherwise. In such cases, the court will rule on the matter as if the party had appeared. [CRC 3.1304(c)](b) [9:153.2] Effect of “no shows”: If neither party gives such notice and no one shows up when the calendar is called, the court may either order the motion off calendar or proceed to rule despite the parties’ absence. [CRC 3.1304(d)]Comment: Such a ruling is likely to be a denial of the motion. Likewise, where only the opposing party appears, and the moving party has not advised the court it is submitting on the tentative, the motion will likely be denied.➪ [9:154] PRACTICE POINTER: There is no requirement that counsel must attend the motion hearing. Frequently, the lawyer for the moving party may find out the tentative ruling and decide to submit on that basis. And, opposing counsel may do likewise, knowing no greater relief can be awarded than that specified in the notice of motion (¶ 9:38). Or, counsel may have reached some agreement prior to the hearing that disposes of the matter entirely.In either case, it is incumbent upon counsel to inform the court before the hearing. If an out-of-court solution has been reached, call the court clerk and have the matter taken off calendar. If you decide to submit on the basis of the tentative ruling, again call the court clerk and so state. Otherwise, you run the risk of having the judge do something else entirely.(c) [9:155] Caution—risk of sanctions: Where the failure to appear at a scheduled hearing violates local rules requiring prior notice to the court, counsel may be sanctioned for the local rules violation. [CCP § 575.2; see ¶ 9:1275]Moreover, causing delay or noncompliance with delay reduction standards may also subject counsel to sanctions. [Gov.C. § 68608(b); see ¶ 12:90 ff.](d) [9:155.1] Resetting motion: If the court has ordered the motion off calendar (rather than ruling on it despite the parties’ absence), the matter may be reset only upon motion. [CRC 3.1304(d)](5) [9:156] Order “off calendar”: The court has discretion to drop any matter from its calendar for “good cause.” This is frequently done where the parties so request, or where they fail to appear at the hearing; or where the court rules on one portion of a matter, making it unnecessary to rule on the balance (e.g., “demurrer sustained with leave to amend; motion to strike off calendar”).An order “off calendar” is not an appealable order. It is not a dismissal, but merely a postponement. The matter may be restored on motion by one of the parties, or on the court’s own motion. [R & A Vending Services v. City of Los Angeles (1985) 172 CA3d 1188, 1193-1194, 218 CR 667, 670] Sometimes the phrase simply means the motion is in effect withdrawn or otherwise mooted.

[9:157] Appearance by telephone: In superior court, counsel may choose to appear by telephone in any conference or in “nonevidentiary” law and motion hearings, at which witnesses are not called to testify, unless the court orders otherwise. [See CRC 3.670] (Telephonic appearances are also permissible in probate hearings, and in certain case management conferences; see ¶ 12:82.10.)The fact that one counsel chooses to appear by telephone does not affect the other’s right to appear in person because all statements made must be audible to all participants. The attorneys appearing by phone must state their names each time they speak so that the court and other counsel can identify the speaker. The proceedings are recorded to the same extent and in the same manner as if counsel appeared in person. [CRC 3.670(l), (m)]It is the court’s responsibility to obtain adequate teleconferencing equipment. [CRC Standards of Jud. Admin., Standard 3.1(a))]A party who has received a fee waiver must not be charged a fee for a telephone appearance. [CRC 3.670(j)]Alert—temporary suspension of old rule: From January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2026, the provisions of CRC 3.670(c) through (i) are suspended and the provisions of CRC 3.672 apply in their place. [CRC 3.670(b); see detailed discussion at ¶ 9:157.3 ff.](1) [9:157.1] Information made available: Each court must publish notice providing parties and attorneys with the information necessary for them to appear by telephone. [CRC 3.670(o)]➪ [9:157.2] PRACTICE POINTERS: The savings in time and money are obvious. But many attorneys are reluctant to appear by telephone. Some feel they have a better chance of winning if they can see the judge’s facial expressions, etc. Others believe that if the other side is going to show up in person they had better do likewise. There is also concern that if they appear by telephone and lose, the client may feel the attorney did not make a sufficient effort. And telephonic appearances can be difficult especially with judges who engage counsel with frequent questions during argument.The validity of these concerns depends on the complexity of the matter and the judge before whom you are appearing.For example, if the judge posts tentative rulings sufficiently in advance of the hearing, you may have a better feeling as to whether anything will be gained by your presence in the courtroom.Likewise, if you feel the judge is more likely to be influenced by written presentation than oral argument, you may decide there is less reason to attend in person. On the other hand, some judges are known for engaging in vigorous discussion at the hearing, and you should consider appearing in person.You should also consider remote appearances via videoconference as an inexpensive alternative to telephone appearances. Videoconferences, depending on the quality of technology employed by the court and by counsel, can provide at least some of the context of an in-person appearance.If there is any doubt in your mind, discuss the matter with the client. (Indeed, hourly-rate clients who are aware that appearances may be made by telephone may expect you to obtain their approval before charging them for in-person court appearances.)(2) [9:157.3] Use of technology for remote appearances: A law expiring January 1, 2027, allows a party to appear remotely after notice to the court and other parties. [CCP § 367.75(a), (m) (amended eff. 1/1/25) (1/1/27 “sunset” date)]The court may require personal appearance, however, if it does not have the necessary equipment for remote appearances or the quality of the equipment is insufficient, or if the court determines, on a case-by-case basis, that personal appearance “would materially assist in the determination of the conference, hearing, or proceeding or in the effective management or resolution of the particular case.” [CCP § 367.75(b)]Expert witnesses may appear remotely, absent good cause to compel in-person testimony. [CCP § 367.75(c)]Trial and other evidentiary hearings may be handled remotely if the court wishes or a party asks, subject to objection by a party (CCP § 367.75(d)(1)), although parties may always appear in person if they wish. [CCP § 367.75(f)]For remote trials and hearings, court reporters (and interpreters, if requested) must be physically in the courtroom. [CCP § 367.75(d)(2)]The court is to warn all parties, especially self-represented litigants, about the risks of remote technologies, such as delays. [CCP § 367.75(e)(3)]Certain proceedings, including contempt under CCP § 1209, are subject to further constraints regarding remote proceedings (see CCP § 367.76 (amended eff. 7/2/24) (1/1/27 “sunset” date)). For example, parties have a right to appear in person or may appear remotely; but if the party subject to the contempt proceeding is physically present, then all parties, counsel and the judicial officer must be physically present (CCP § 367.76(d)). The court reporter also must be physically present unless there are “unusual circumstances” (CCP § 367.76(f)(1)). As of July 2024, court reporters must in any event be personally present in the courtroom. [CCP § 367.76(f)(2)](a) [9:157.4] Remote appearances—Rules of Court: Pursuant to CCP § 367.75, the Judicial Council adopted CRC 3.672, which allows courts to enact local rules for remote appearances (CRC 3.672(e)) and provides statewide defaults if there are no applicable local rules. (CRC 3.670(c) through (i) (relating to telephone appearances) have been suspended, and CRC 3.672 is applicable through January 1, 2026; CRC 3.670(b).)Courts “should permit” parties to appear remotely “to the extent feasible” (CRC 3.672(a)), but may require in-person appearances at proceedings subject to CRC 3.672 on a hearing-by-hearing basis, or if the court does not have adequate technology. [CRC 3.672(d)]1) [9:157.5] Notice requirements: CRC 3.672 distinguishes trial and other evidentiary hearings from other proceedings:• Nonevidentiary proceedings: For proceedings other than evidentiary hearings or trials that have at least three court days’ notice, a party must provide notice of the party’s intent to appear remotely at least two court days before the proceeding. [CRC 3.672(g)(2)(A)(i)]Notice to the court must be given by filing a Notice of Remote Appearance (mandatory Judicial Council form RA-010). Notice to the other parties may be provided in writing, electronically, or orally. [CRC 3.672(g)(2)(A)(ii)] If there is less than three court days’ notice of the hearing, shorter time periods and different notice processes apply. [CRC 3.672(g)(2)(B)] • Evidentiary hearings or trials: A court intending to conduct an evidentiary hearing or trial remotely in a case subject to CRC 3.672 must provide at least 10 court days’ notice of the remote proceeding (or at least two court days’ notice if the hearing or trial is on less than 10 court days’ notice). [CRC 3.672(h)(1)(A)]Courts may also require by local rule remote appearances at certain evidentiary hearings or trial, subject to agreement by self-represented parties and objection by other parties. [CRC 3.672(h)(1)(B)] Parties may notice an intent to appear remotely. For hearings and trials held on less than 15 court days’ notice, parties must notice an intent to appear remotely at least 10 court days’ before the hearing or trial. [CRC 3.672(h)(2)(C)] Notice to the court must be given by filing a Notice of Remote Appearance (mandatory Judicial Council form RA-010). Notice to the other parties may be provided in writing, electronically, or orally.

At any time during a case subject to CRC 3.672, a party may provide notice to the court and all other parties or persons entitled to notice that the party intends to appear remotely for the duration of a case, so long as the requisite amount of notice is provided (as prescribed by CRC 3.672 or local court rules or procedures). [CRC 3.672(f)(1)]2) [9:157.7] Court may permit party to appear remotely: Even if a party does not request a remote appearance, the “court may permit the party to appear remotely upon a finding of good cause, unforeseen circumstances, or that the remote appearance would permit access to justice.” [CRC 3.672(j)(2) (emphasis added)]Comment: Neither the statute nor the Rules define “good cause,” so the court apparently has discretion here.(3) [9:158] Which cases: The CRC 3.672 remote proceedings provisions apply to all civil cases subject to CCP § 367.75; i.e., all civil cases (with limited exceptions). [CRC 3.672(b); see CRC 3.670 (authorizing telephonic appearances in general civil cases as defined in CRC 1.6 and in unlawful detainer and probate proceedings), 5.9 (authorizing telephonic appearances in family law matters), 5.324 (authorizing telephonic appearances in child or family support matters)]Alert—temporary suspension of old rules: As with CRC 3.670 (see ¶ 9:157), from January 1, 2022, to January 1, 2026, the provisions of CRC 5.9(b) through (d) and CRC 5.324 are suspended and the provisions of CRC 3.672 apply in their place.

[CRC 3.672(d)]Remote appearances for ex parte applications are subject to special rules (see ¶ 9:159.2).[9:159.1] Reserved.(a) [9:159.2] Ex parte applications: Rules on notice (including that required for ex parte applications) found in CRC 3.670 are suspended until January 1, 2026 (see CRC 3.670(b), (d)). CRC 3.672 generally defers to local rules posted on a court’s website (CRC 3.672(e)), and encourages remote attendance unless a judge in a specific situation determines a personal appearance is required. [CRC 3.672(d); see ¶ 9:162] CRC 3.672 has different rules for evidentiary as opposed to nonevidentiary hearings (see ¶ 9:157.5).For ex parte hearings (usually not evidentiary, and where notice is less than 3 days), notice of remote appearance is provided with the papers (CRC 3.672(g)(2)(B)(i)(a)). Notice to the court must be given by filing Notice of Remote Appearance (mandatory Judicial Council form RA-010), and notice of the remote appearance to the other parties “may be provided in writing, electronically, or orally in a way reasonably calculated to ensure notice is received with notice of the moving papers.” [CRC 3.672(g)(2)(B)(i)(b)]As the instructions for form RA-010 note, this specific notice is not necessary if the court has specified its own method of notice or, for example, handles law and motion remotely as a default.

[CRC 3.672(d)(3)]The court also may require an in-person appearance if “the court does not have the technology to conduct the proceeding remotely, or if the quality of the technology prevents the effective management or resolution of the proceeding.” [CRC 3.672(d)(2)][9:163] Reserved.(6) [9:164] Impact on fee awards? In awarding attorney fees (under any applicable provision of law), courts may consider whether the attorney is claiming fees for appearing in person when that attorney could have appeared by telephone.

Oral argument(1) [9:165] Right to hearing on certain motions: A right to a full hearing is recognized where required by statute and on “critical pretrial matters.” [Titmas v. Sup.Ct. (Iavarone) (2001) 87 CA4th 738, 742, 104 CR2d 803, 807]The right to a “hearing” means “an oral hearing at which the court may take evidence, entertain and rule on evidentiary objections, and determine the merits based on written and oral presentations.” [Hobbs v. Weiss (1999) 73 CA4th 76, 78, 86 CR2d 146, 147 (emphasis added)]Effect of tentative ruling? The right to oral argument may be affected by the court’s posting a telephonic tentative ruling; see ¶ 9:113 ff.(a) [9:165.1] When required by statute: Statutes using the term “motion” (rather than ex parte application) may be interpreted to require both notice and an oral hearing. [See Titmas v. Sup.Ct. (Iavarone), supra, 87 CA4th at 742-743, 104 CR2d at 807—court must determine whether “statutory scheme, read as a whole, encompasses an oral hearing”][9:165.2 - 9:165.4] Reserved.(b) [9:165.5] Where statute unclear: Where the statute uses imprecise terms such as “heard” or “hearing,” the court should consider the following factors in determining whether to forgo oral argument:• whether the judge will act as a factfinder or adjudicate any issues at the hearing;• whether the litigants are entitled to any procedural remedies at the time of the hearing (making evidentiary objections, orally moving for a continuance, etc.);• whether the issues are so obvious and well-settled that oral argument “would amount to an empty gesture”; and• whether the proceedings involve “critical pretrial matters of considerable significance to the parties.” [TJX Companies, Inc. v.

Sup.Ct. (Burchard), supra, 87 CA4th at 755, 104 CR2d at 815][9:167] Reserved.(3) [9:168] Argument not permitted unless opposition filed: If a party fails to file timely written opposition to a motion or demurrer, the judge may refuse to permit oral argument against the motion. The judge, as a matter of discretion, may consider a request for continuance to allow filing of a written opposition. Because continuances are not favored, valid reasons will have to be shown for the failure to file or late filing of opposing papers.If a continuance is granted, the court may require the opposing party (or counsel) to pay fees for the appearance incurred by other parties.➪ [9:169] PRACTICE POINTER: In such a case, the better practice is to seek a stipulated continuance before coming to court. If opposing counsel refuses, the judge may be sympathetic. But you’ll have to have a good excuse for failure to file a timely opposition in order to get your continuance.(4) Effective argument techniques➪ [9:170] PRACTICE POINTERS: Time for oral argument is always limited, so make your argument meaningful. Here are some suggestions:• Prepare in advance. Have key documents at your fingertips. Boil down your argument to a few key points.• When the case is called, move promptly to the counsel table. In many courts, there is a sign indicating where counsel for the respective parties should be seated. Absent such sign, plaintiff’s lawyer traditionally takes the counsel table nearest the jury box. Stand at the counsel table or, if a lectern is provided, at the lectern when addressing the court.• When it is your turn to address the court:— wait until you have the court’s attention;— state your name, the name of your firm and whom you represent;— speak slowly and loudly enough for the judge and reporter to hear;— stand up straight at the lectern or counsel table (avoid hands in pockets, slouching or fiddling with papers);— try to establish eye contact with the judge and to appear confident of your position.• Sometimes, you will encounter a judge who attempts to preempt argument by saying: “I’ve read all your papers. Do you have anything to add? (And, if so, why isn’t it in your brief?)”If you’re the moving party and haven’t had time to file a reply brief, use this as an opportunity to point out weaknesses in the opposing party’s papers. Otherwise, invite questions from the court and attempt to respond to such questions and any tentative ruling. • If the tentative ruling is in your favor, say nothing or simply respond to whatever points your opponent makes.• If the tentative ruling is against you, address it at the outset of your argument. Do not simply argue it is “wrong.” Rather, try to point out why the tentative ruling is impractical or would lead to an unfair result; why some of the facts stated or assumptions made by the court are mistaken; or why the ruling is inconsistent with cases cited in your brief.• Do not simply rehash points in your papers. Rather, respond to whatever questions the judge has raised (directing the judge, if necessary, to the particular pages or paragraphs of your declarations or memorandum of points and authorities).• Focus on your strongest arguments. If necessary, concede minor points that do not affect the outcome.• Be prepared to discuss the facts of the cases cited by you and your opponent. Even direct quotes from cases cited in your memorandum of points and authorities gain (or lose) significance for your case depending upon their facts.• Stay cool. Do not argue with opposing counsel. Address your remarks to the court. If opposing counsel addresses a comment or question to you, ask the court if it wishes you to respond.• Don’t interrupt opposing counsel or the judge.• Be prepared to be interrupted by the court. Listen patiently and carefully to the judge’s questions and address them directly. You should welcome the opportunity to respond to issues raised by the court, rather than being irritated (as some lawyers are) at the interruption.• Avoid demeaning opposing counsel or their client. Doing so makes you appear unprofessional and detracts from the merit of your argument.• Avoid “last minute” citations of authority during oral argument. Instead, if the citations are really important, ask for leave to submit a supplemental memorandum.• If you feel you are losing the argument, also ask for leave to file supplemental declarations or points and authorities on what appear to be the key issues. This sometimes will set the stage for the judge to reconsider and come to a different conclusion.• Show respect for the court. Address the judge as “Your Honor” (not simply, “Judge”). Do not argue with the judge after the judge has ruled.d. [9:171] Court reporters: Although some courts still provide court reporters at all civil law and motion hearings and trials, courts are increasingly opting not to do so.If the court does not provide a reporter, its local rules must so state and spell out the procedure for obtaining a reporter (see CRC 3.1310). In such cases, parties are entitled to arrange for a certified reporter at their own expense (fees may be recoverable as court costs). [CRC 2.956(c); see Fasuyi v. Permatex, Inc. (2008) 167 CA4th 681, 690, 84 CR3d 351, 357, fn. 5 (citing text)]➪ [9:171.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Check with the court to determine whether there are any special procedures associated with providing your own court reporter. For example, the Los Angeles Superior Court requires that the parties and court reporter sign a stipulation, which is entered as an order appointing the reporter as the official reporter for the proceeding. The stipulation form may be obtained on the court’s website (www.lacourt.org).(1) [9:171.2] Verbatim record for indigent litigants: Where local rules do not provide for court reporters for civil cases but allow litigants to arrange for reporters at their own expense, a court must provide a verbatim record for litigants who have obtained a fee waiver (Gov.C. § 68631, see ¶ 1:188) and who request a reporter. [Jameson v. Desta (2018) 5 C5th 594, 599, 234 CR3d 831, 834; Davis v. Sup.Ct. (Sathre) (2020) 50 CA5th 607, 615-616, 264 CR3d 116, 122—party entitled to new hearing due to court’s failure to provide requested reporter; see CRC 2.956(c)(2)(D)](a) [9:171.3] Courts developing policies to comply with Jameson: Since July 2018, individual courts have been addressing the new Jameson requirement (¶ 9:171.2). The California Supreme Court recognized the significant cost of court reporters and acknowledged that courts had eliminated them in some civil cases because of budgetary issues. [See Jameson v. Desta, supra, 5 C5th at 598, 610-611, 234 CR3d at 833, 844 & fn. 2]Court websites should be checked to determine which procedures each court is adopting to address the Jameson requirement. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 2.21(a), (b)—request required 10 days in advance on form LACIV 269 in unlimited cases; electronic recording is provided for limited jurisdiction cases](b) [9:171.4] Retroactive: At least one court has held that Jameson’s holding (¶ 9:171.2) is retroactive to all cases not yet final, and that parties with fee waivers who had requested a court reporter and had not been provided with one could be granted a new trial if the failure to have a transcript affected the party’s appellate rights. [Dogan v. Comanche Hills Apartments, Inc. (2019) 31 CA5th 566, 567-568, 242 CR3d 702, 703](2) [9:171.4a] Verbatim record in other limited circumstances in some courts: Some courts, such as Los Angeles and Santa Clara, will provide litigants access to a verbatim record of the proceedings where the court is unable to provide an official court reporter due to a reporter shortage, the litigant cannot secure a private sector court reporter at the litigant’s expense, and the judicial officer makes specific findings that fundamental constitutional rights are at stake. [See LA Sup.Ct. General Order 2024-GEN-011-00 (9/5/24) (available at www.lacourt.org); Santa Clara General Order re Operation of Electronic Recording Equipment for Specified Proceedings Involving Fundamental Liberty Interests in the Absence of an Available Court Reporter (11/14/24) (available at www.santaclara.courts.ca.gov)](3) [9:171.5] Electronic recording in limited jurisdiction cases: A court can provide for electronic recording in limited civil cases. [See Gov.C. § 69957; CRC 2.952]A written transcript of the electronic recording may be made “by or under the direction of” the clerk or a person designated by the court, and the person making the transcript must declare under penalty of perjury that the transcript is a “full, true, and correct” transcript. Such a transcript satisfies all requirements for a reporter’s transcript. [CRC 2.952(g), (h)]On stipulation of the parties and approval by the reviewing court, the electronic recording or copies of it may satisfy the requirements for a reporter’s transcript for all purposes. [CRC 2.952(j)(1)](4) [9:172] Transcript may be essential for appellate review: Unless a court reporter is present, the losing party may have no effective way of challenging the court’s ruling by writ or appeal: “In the absence of a transcript the reviewing court will have no way of knowing … what grounds were advanced, what arguments were made and what facts may have been admitted, mutually assumed or judicially noticed at the hearing. In such a case, no abuse of discretion can be found except on the basis of speculation.” [Snell v. Sup.Ct. (Marshall Hosp.) (1984) 158 CA3d 44, 49, 204 CR 200, 203 (emphasis added; internal quotes omitted); see also Foust v. San Jose Const. Co., Inc. (2011) 198 CA4th 181, 186-187, 129 CR3d 421, 424-425—appellate courts have refused to reach merits of appellant’s claims because no reporter’s transcript of pertinent proceeding or suitable substitute provided (collecting cases)]If the proceeding was electronically recorded, a transcript may be made of the recording (see ¶ 9:171.5).In some situations, however, the appellate court may hear the merits of an appeal without a record of the hearing, such as when the review is de novo and the record includes all relevant material.

Cole (2012) 210 CA4th 692, 696, 148 CR3d 451, 452-453]➪ [9:173] PRACTICE POINTERS: If you are appearing in a court in which law and motion hearings are not regularly reported and the proceedings are not electronically recorded by court rule (see ¶ 9:171.5), and there is the slightest chance you would seek appellate review if the judge rules against you, be sure to make arrangements to have a court reporter present.If the argument is not reported, but you wish to preserve your ability to seek review of the ruling by writ or appeal, attempt to obtain an “agreed” or “settled statement” of the proceedings. [See CRC 8.130(h); Maria P. v. Riles (1987) 43 C3d 1281, 1295, 240 CR 872, 881 (noting that, in absence of reporter’s transcript, appellant should have augmented record with settled statement “to provide an adequate record to assess error”); Elena S. v.

Prac. Guide: Civil Appeals & Writs (TRG), Ch. 4.(5) [9:174] Caution—failure to request reporter as malpractice? If the matter is one in which a transcript may be essential for appellate review, it may constitute malpractice for an attorney to fail to have a court reporter present. [See In re Christina P. (1985) 175 CA3d 115, 128, 220 CR 525, 531—failure to request court reporter in proceeding to remove child from parental custody raised “cognizable claim” of ineffective assistance of counsel]e. [9:175] Oral testimony: As stated earlier, judges usually decide motions based on evidence presented in the form of affidavits or declarations, rather than oral testimony (see ¶ 9:43 ff.).Even so, the court has discretion to receive oral testimony, as well as exclude it. There are situations in which the judge may, in the exercise of such discretion, decide to hear witnesses or to allow cross-examination of a declarant. [Rosenthal v. Great Western Fin’l Secur. Corp. (1996) 14 C4th 394, 414, 58 CR2d 875, 886](1) [9:176] Prehearing request: At least 3 court days before the hearing, the party requesting leave to introduce oral testimony must file a statement as to the nature and extent of the proposed testimony, and a reasonable time estimate for the hearing. [CRC 3.1306(b); see ¶ 9:45.1](2) [9:177] Court must consider request for oral testimony: The judge may not adopt a policy of outright refusal to consider oral testimony on a motion hearing. Rather, if requested by either party, the judge must exercise discretion as to whether oral testimony would be necessary or helpful to the decision of the matter. [Reifler v. Sup.Ct. (1974) 39 CA3d 479, 485, 114 CR 356, 359](3) [9:178] Appellate review limited to abuse of discretion: The judge’s refusal order may be reviewable by extraordinary writ, but such writs are granted only if abuse of discretion is shown (which is difficult to establish with rulings on requests to introduce live testimony). [Eddy v. Temkin (1985) 167 CA3d 1115, 1121, 213 CR 597, 601—no abuse shown on refusal to hear oral testimony on petition for partnership charging order where documents and depositions were more important to resolving factual issues than opportunity to examine and observe demeanor of live witnesses]➪ [9:178.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Don’t rely on being able to present oral testimony. Even if you intend to seek permission to offer such testimony, prepare declarations in such a manner that the court’s refusal to consider oral testimony will not leave gaps in your evidence. The request should specifically identify the material facts to be elicited through oral testimony. Explain why oral testimony is needed to assess credibility or to resolve factual disputes. If you cannot present written testimony, explain why not.[9:178.2 - 9:178.4] Reserved.f. [9:178.5] Open to the public: Civil as well as criminal proceedings must generally be open to the public (see CCP § 124). This includes matters that may be heard outside the courthouse before a temporary judge or referee. [See CRC 2.834, 3.931]First Amendment standards govern closure of any substantive proceeding (which may include law and motion proceedings). [NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Locke) (1999) 20 C4th 1178, 1222, 86 CR2d 778, 812-813—trial judge improperly excluded public and press from courtroom proceedings involving celebrities without any showing that their right to fair trial could not be secured by less restrictive means] For this reason a strong, particularized showing is required to seal documents filed with the court (see ¶ 9:416 ff.). 5. Judge’s Rulinga. [9:179] Submitted matters: Most judges try to dispose of all matters on their calendar before leaving the bench. Other times, a matter will be sufficiently complicated that the judge cannot fully address it without further study; or the judge may wish to consider the impact of documents that were filed late; or the judge may have granted the parties the right to submit additional declarations or points and authorities. Then, the judge may decline to rule from the bench, and instead take the matter under submission.b. [9:180] Formal rulings generally not required: There is no requirement that a court make a formal, written ruling in a law and motion matter. Oral on-the-record rulings suffice to provide proper appellate review. [See Biljac Assocs. v. First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A. (1990) 218 CA3d 1410, 1419, 267 CR 819, 823 (disapproved on other grounds by Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 C4th 512, 532, 113 CR3d 327, 344, fn. 8); Southwestern Law School v. Benson (2019) 42 CA5th Supp. 1, 9, 254 CR3d 629, 634 (quoting text)]Exceptions to this include the appointment of referees (see ¶ 9:183 ff.). See also ¶ 9:252 ff.c. [9:181] Effect of court’s failure to rule: At least in the context of motions for summary judgment/adjudication, trial courts have a duty to rule on properly presented material evidentiary objections (CCP § 437c(q)). If the court fails to rule, objections properly presented are preserved on appeal. [Reid v. Google, Inc., supra, 50 C4th at 532, 113 CR3d at 343-344; see ¶ 9:63.1][9:182] Reserved.d. [9:183] Appointment of referee: The court may appoint a referee in any case with the parties’ consent (CCP § 638). It may also appoint a referee without their consent in certain cases, including:• “when a question of fact, other than upon the pleadings, arises upon motion or otherwise, in any stage of the action”;• to hear and determine discovery disputes under specified circumstances (see ¶ 8:1803 ff.). [CCP § 639(a)(3), (5)](1) [9:184] Not for legal issues: Law and motion matters cannot routinely be assigned to a referee without the parties’ consent. This includes motions for summary judgment; such motions do not involve “questions of fact” but rather an issue of law (i.e., whether a triable question of fact exists). [International Jet Ski Boating Ass’n, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Parker) (1991) 232 CA3d 112, 115-116, 283 CR 33, 34-35](2) [9:185] Who may be appointed: The referee may be a court commissioner, or someone entirely outside the court system; e.g., retired judges, private lawyers or even nonlawyers. [See Martino v. Denevi (1986) 182 CA3d 553, 556, 227 CR 354, 356—accountant appointed as referee](3) [9:185.1] Written order required: All nonconsensual appointments must be in writing and state the reasons the referee is appointed. [CCP § 639(d)](4) [9:186] Detailed findings required for appointment of discovery referees, allocation of fees, etc.: Detailed rules and procedures governing appointment of discovery referees, including written findings by the court as to the necessity for such appointment, must be set forth in the appointment order. [CCP § 639(d); see ¶ 8:742 ff.](5) [9:187] Referee’s report only advisory: Except where the parties have agreed to a general reference (covering all matters in the case), the referee’s findings and report to the court are merely advisory. [CCP § 644; see Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Hammer) (1986) 182 CA3d 431, 436, 227 CR 460, 464; Yu v. Sup.Ct. (Bank of the West) (2020) 56 CA5th 636, 646-647, 270 CR3d 606, 612-613—following consensual general reference, decision of referee stands as decision of court and aggrieved party can only challenge decision by postjudgment motion or an appeal](6) [9:188] Timely objection required: A party who fails to file written objections to the referee’s report within 10 days after it is filed may be held to have waived any objections to the report. The other party has 10 days to respond to the objections. [CCP § 643(c); see Martino v. Denevi, supra, 182 CA3d at 557-558, 227 CR at 356-357](7) [9:189] Court hearing not mandatory: Although the court must review the referee’s findings and any objections thereto, no hearing is required as a matter of law. The review may be accomplished “in whatever manner the trial court deems appropriate.” [Marathon Nat’l Bank v. Sup.Ct. (Campbell) (1993) 19 CA4th 1256, 1258, 24 CR2d 40, 40-41]Cross-refer: Rules and procedures governing appointment of referees are discussed in detail in Knight, Chernick, Quinn & Gupta, Cal. Prac.

[9:251] Findings/statement of decision normally not required: With a few exceptions (¶ 9:252), findings of fact are not required in connection with law and motion rulings. [See Beckett v. Kaynar Mfg. Co. (1958) 49 C2d 695, 699, 321 P2d 749, 751; Laabs v. City of Victorville (2008) 163 CA4th 1242, 1272, 78 CR3d 372, 398 (citing text)]This rule applies as well to a CCP § 632 statement of decision “even if the motion involves an evidentiary issue and even if the order is appealable.” [Lien v. Lucky United Properties Investment, Inc. (2008) 163 CA4th 620, 623-624, 77 CR3d 707, 708](1) [9:252] Exceptions: Findings are required in a few instances, including:— orders appointing discovery referees (see ¶ 9:186);— orders sealing court records (see ¶ 9:418 ff.);— if timely requested, orders ruling on petitions to compel arbitration (CCP § 1291; Metis Develop. LLC v. Bohacek (2011) 200 CA4th 679, 687-689, 133 CR3d 585, 591-593; see ¶ 9:408.31 ff.);— if timely requested, orders confirming arbitration awards (CCP § 1291).[9:253 - 9:254] Reserved.b. [9:255] Statement of reasons or grounds: In ruling on certain motions, the court must state the reasons or grounds for its order. These include:(1) [9:256] Sustaining of demurrer: An order sustaining a demurrer must state the “specific ground or grounds” upon which it is based (which may be by reference to appropriate pages and paragraphs of the demurrer). [CCP § 472d; see ¶ 7:126 ff.](2) [9:257] Grant of summary judgment: An order granting summary judgment or summary adjudication must specify the “reasons” for the court’s determination and cite both supporting and opposing evidence to show there is no triable issue of fact. [CCP § 437c(g), (f)(2); California-American Water Co. v. Marina Coast Water Dist. (2022) 86 CA5th 1272, 1298-1299, 303 CR3d 227, 247; see ¶ 10:331 ff.](3) [9:258] Denial of summary judgment: An order denying summary judgment or summary adjudication must specify one or more material facts in controversy and cite the conflicting evidence on this point. [CCP § 437c(g), (f)(2); see ¶ 10:352 ff.][9:259 - 9:260] Reserved.(4) [9:261] Appointment of referee: An order appointing a referee must state the reasons for the appointment. See ¶ 9:185.1 ff.(5) [9:262] Class actions: Trial judges must state their reasons for denying class certification, which are the only grounds for denial that can be reviewed on appeal. [McCleery v. Allstate Ins. Co. (2019) 37 CA5th 434, 450, 249 CR3d 765, 778](6) [9:263] Sanctions awards: An order imposing sanctions (for other than discovery abuses) must be in writing and “recite in detail the action or tactic or circumstances justifying the order.” [CCP § 128.5(c), (e); see ¶ 9:1108 ff.][9:264 - 9:293] Reserved. 2. [9:294] Preparation of Order: Unless the court orders otherwise or notice is waived, the prevailing party must, within 5 days after the ruling, serve a proposed order on opposing counsel by means authorized by law and reasonably calculated to ensure delivery by the close of the next business day, without any extension of time based on the manner of service. [CRC 3.1312(a)] (This includes rulings on demurrers; a demurrer is listed as a “pleadings motion”; see CRC 3.1320.)Opposing counsel then has 5 days after service (again, without any extension of time based on the manner of service) to notify the prevailing party’s counsel of any objections to the proposed order, stating the reasons for its objections. [CRC 3.1312(a)]The prevailing party must then promptly transmit the proposed order to the court, together with a summary of any responses received from opposing counsel or a statement that no responses were received. [CRC 3.1312(b)]Special requirements apply where the proposed order is submitted to the court electronically. [See CRC 3.1312(c)]➪ [9:295] PRACTICE POINTER: If a complex ruling is made in open court, ask the court reporter for a “same day” transcript of the order to make sure you get it verbatim. This helps avoid disputes with opposing counsel as to precisely what was ordered. (This is particularly important with orders granting or denying summary judgment, where the triable or nontriable issues have to be specified in the order, along with citations to the evidence; see ¶ 10:331 ff.)a. [9:296] Compare—unopposed motions: If the motion was unopposed and a proposed order was submitted with the moving papers, the proposed order need not again be submitted unless the court so orders. [CRC 3.1312(e)][9:297 - 9:298] Reserved.b. [9:299] Judicial Council form orders: Where a mandatory Judicial Council form order exists (e.g., MC-053: Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil), it must be used and the court may not order counsel to alter it. The court itself, however, may modify a Judicial Council form order “as necessary or appropriate to adjudicate a particular case.” [CRC 1.31(e)]c. [9:300] Attorney-drafted order: Where an attorney order is required, the proposed order should be drafted as follows:• The name of the lawyer preparing the order and the party represented should appear in the upper left hand corner of the first page (see ¶ 9:81.4).• Title your proposed order as such: i.e., “(Proposed) Order Granting Motion …” The judge can strike out “Proposed” before signing the order. This avoids the confusion created where court files contain documents denominated “Order” although never adopted or signed by the court (see ¶ 9:81.2a).The title of the order should also state the result or the relief granted; e.g., “(Proposed) Order Granting Motion to Strike Affirmative Defense” or “(Proposed) Order for Further Answers to Interrogatories and for Payment of Attorney Fees.” • The introductory paragraph should state the date, time and department in which the hearing took place, the name of the judge presiding, and the names of each attorney present and whom they represented.• The body of the order should set forth findings and reasons where required (see ¶ 9:251 ff.) and all relief granted.FORM: Proposed Order (Posthearing), see Form 9A:15 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:301 - 9:314] Reserved.d. [9:315] Opposing counsel’s options: The opposing party has 5 days after the “mailing or delivery” to notify the prevailing counsel as to any objections as to the form of the proposed order, stating any reasons for disapproval. Failure to so notify the prevailing party within the 5-day period is deemed an approval as to form. [CRC 3.1312(a)](1) [9:316] No extension for service by mail: CCP § 1013, which usually extends time for response where papers are served by mail or other means, does not extend the time for opposing counsel to respond. [CRC 3.1312(a)]➪ [9:317] PRACTICE POINTER: Note the very short time period allowed: 5 days after the mailing of the order. The result is that if you are the losing counsel, you may have to act immediately upon receipt of the proposed order.If you have objections, email or fax them to opposing counsel. Even if fax service is not otherwise allowable (see ¶ 9:86.10), it would constitute “notification” for purposes of CRC 3.1312. It also avoids disputes that might arise with oral notification.If the order is complex and your objections elaborate, follow up with mailing copies to opposing counsel and to the court. (This ensures the court will receive your full response rather than merely opposing counsel’s “summary” of it.)e. [9:318] Delivery to court: Upon expiration of the 5-day period for approval by opposing counsel, the prevailing party must deliver the proposed order to the court together with a summary of any responses by other parties or a statement that no responses were received. [CRC 3.1312(b)](1) [9:318a] Submission by electronic means: If the parties are filing electronically, two versions of the proposed order must be submitted:• A version attached to a completed Proposed Order (Cover Sheet) (mandatory Judicial Council form EFS-020), and the combined document in PDF; and• A version in an editable word-processing format, with a copy of the email and proposed order also being sent to all parties in the action. [CRC 3.1312(c)]➪ [9:318.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Your duty of candor to the court requires disclosure of the opposing party’s responses to a proposed order. Moreover, failure to do so usually results in further motions and hearings pertaining to the form of the order, involving unnecessary expense to your client.f. [9:319] Effect of failure to comply: If the prevailing party fails to prepare and submit the order as above provided (¶ 9:294 ff.), any other party may do so. [CRC 3.1312(d)]➪ [9:319.1] PRACTICE POINTER: This is what you may need to do to seek appellate review of an adverse ruling when the prevailing party is dragging its feet on preparing the order. No appeal or writ petition (see ¶ 9:344.25) can be filed until an order is filed. 3. [9:320] Notice of Ruling: Once the order is entered, unless the court orders otherwise, the prevailing party must prepare a notice of the court’s ruling and serve it on all other parties or their attorneys—unless they were present at the hearing and waived notice. [CCP § 1019.5(a)]Exceptions: When an order is entered sua sponte (on court’s own motion), it is the court’s responsibility to prepare and serve the notice of ruling (CCP § 1019.5(b)). Similarly, when the court rules on a matter it has taken under submission, the clerk must immediately notify the parties of the ruling or order by mailing the parties a copy. [CRC 3.1109(a)]a. [9:320.1] Purpose of notice: The notice is required to start the time running:— to amend or answer after the court’s ruling on demurrer (CCP § 472b; see ¶ 7:134); or— to seek reconsideration (CCP § 1008(a); see Forrest v. State of Calif. Dept. of Corps. (2007) 150 CA4th 183, 203, 58 CR3d 466, 481 (citing text) (disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 C4th 1164, 1172, 126 CR3d 98, 103, fn. 3); and ¶ 9:324 ff.); or— to file an appeal of the denial of a motion to vacate a judgment entered without notice to the parties (Kalenian v. Insen (2014) 225 CA4th 569, 578, 170 CR3d 755, 761—plaintiffs’ appeal of denial of motion for relief to allow late appeal deemed timely where court failed to serve parties with notice of judge’s dismissal orders as required by law); or— to take a writ petition (see Cal West Nurseries, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (A.J. West Ranch, LLC) (2005) 129 CA4th 1170, 1173-1174, 29 CR3d 170, 173).It also assures that parties not present at the hearing are aware of the court’s order.b. [9:320.2] Content of notice: The notice of ruling should state the exact terms of the court’s order as entered, and should include the date of entry.(1) [9:320.3] Copy of order as notice: The prevailing party may serve a “file-stamped copy” of the order as notice of ruling: “There can be no better notice of what an order says than is provided by a file-stamped copy of the order itself.” [Parris v. Cave (1985) 174 CA3d 292, 294, 219 CR 871, 873]FORM: Notice of Ruling, see Form 9A:16 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(2) [9:320.4] Compare—order: A “notice of ruling” is addressed to the other parties and is signed by counsel. An “order” is not so addressed and is signed by the court.➪ [9:320.4a] PRACTICE POINTER: In event of any discrepancy between the two, the order is the governing document. Therefore, if an issue arises as to what action was taken by the court, refer to the appropriate formal or minute order (and supply copies thereof if appropriate), not to the notice of ruling. Alternatively, parties (or the court on its own) may move to correct the minutes, including remedying omissions. The motion may be made at any time. [Nunn v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2021) 64 CA5th 346, 360-361, 278 CR3d 726, 738-739]c. [9:320.5] Service of notice: Notice is generally served by mail on the attorney of record for each other party who has appeared in the action or on the party itself, if self-represented. Note that if a party is being represented by a law firm, the firm’s name must be included in the address; service is improper if addressed only to a lawyer within the firm. [See Triumph Precision Products, Inc. v. Insurance Co. of North America (1979) 91 CA3d 362, 365, 154 CR 120, 122](It is good practice to include both the firm name and the name of the individual attorney within the firm who is handling the matter. Indeed, this is required under some local court rules.)[9:320.6] Reserved.d. [9:320.7] Waiver of notice: If all parties to the action are present at the time of the ruling, they may waive notice thereof. To be effective, such waiver must be in open court and entered in the minutes. [CCP § 1019.5(a)]➪ [9:320.8] PRACTICE POINTER: If you are the losing party, do not automatically waive notice. If a demurrer is involved, your insisting on notice will provide you with some extra time to plead. Also, if the ruling is at all complicated, insisting on notice helps avoid confusion and misunderstandings as to the specifics involved.Another reason to insist on notice is that it helps avoid slip-ups caused by failure to take accurate notes of the court’s ruling (e.g., dates for filing briefs, continued hearings, etc.). This is a particular problem where more than one attorney in your firm is handling the file. Neglect in noting the court’s ruling is imputed to all members of the firm, and is not “excusable.” [Griffis v. S.S. Kresge Co. (1984) 150 CA3d 491, 497, 197 CR 771, 775—“The instant matter readily demonstrates the perils of waiving notice” (emphasis added)][9:321] Reserved. 4. [9:322] Procedures to Change Ruling in Trial Court: Until an order is signed and entered, the court retains power to change its mind and reverse or modify its ruling. [Bernstein v. Consolidated American Ins. Co. (1995) 37 CA4th 763, 774, 43 CR2d 817, 823 (disapproved on other grounds by Vandenberg v. Sup.Ct. (Centennial Ins. Co.) (1999) 21 C4th 815, 841, 88 CR2d 366, 384, fn. 13)]Once the order is entered, however, the court can set aside or modify its order only through the procedures discussed below (¶ 9:323 ff.).a. [9:323] “Jurisdictional” limitation on party’s motion: No application to reconsider a prior order (¶ 9:324 ff.) or for renewal of a previous motion (¶ 9:337 ff.) may be considered except as provided below (¶ 9:323.1 ff.). [CCP § 1008(e)—“This section specifies the court’s jurisdiction with regard to applications for reconsideration … and renewals of previous motions” (emphasis added); see Garcia v. Hejmadi (1997) 58 CA4th 674, 691, 68 CR2d 228, 239—plaintiff’s judgment reversed because court “lacked jurisdiction” to grant plaintiff’s motion to reconsider earlier order granting summary judgment to defendant](1) [9:323.1] Compare—court’s inherent power to reconsider: CCP § 1008 does not, however, limit the court’s inherent power to reevaluate its interim rulings on its own motion, and to enter a new and different order any time prior to entry of judgment. See detailed discussion at ¶ 9:327 ff.(2) [9:323.2] Compare—in limine motions: Motions in limine are not binding and are subject to reconsideration upon full information at trial, “because the trial court has the power to reconsider, modify or set aside its order at any time prior to the submission of the cause.” [Cristler v. Express Messenger Systems, Inc. (2009) 171 CA4th 72, 90, 89 CR3d 34, 48, fn. 6 (internal quotes omitted); Scott v. C.R. Bard, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 763, 784, 180 CR3d 479, 496—“In limine rulings are tentative and the court retains discretion to make different rulings as the evidence unfolds”; Bassett Unified School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Ross) (2023) 89 CA5th 273, 288, 305 CR3d 647, 660, fn. 11][9:323.3 - 9:323.4] Reserved.b. [9:323.5] “Interim or final” orders: CCP § 1008 governs motions to reconsider and renewals of previous motions based on an application for an order to the court, whether the challenged order is “interim or final.” [CCP § 1008(e), (h); see Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 CA4th 1192, 1199, 69 CR2d 592, 597]c. [9:324] Motion for reconsideration: Under the following conditions, the losing party may make a motion before the same judge to reconsider and enter a different order (CCP § 1008(a)). Such motion must be:• brought before the same judge who made the order (¶ 9:324.3);• “made within 10 days after service upon the party of notice of entry of the order” (¶ 9:325);• based on “new or different facts, circumstances or law” than those before the court at the time of the original ruling (¶ 9:328);• supported by declaration stating the previous order, by which judge it was made, and the new or different facts, circumstances or law claimed to exist (¶ 9:331); and• made and decided before entry of judgment (¶ 9:332.1).There is a two-step process. If the motion for reconsideration meets the requirements of CCP § 1008, then the court grants reconsideration and proceeds to the merits of the motion—which may result in reaffirmation of the original order. [Randy’s Trucking, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Buttram) (2023) 91 CA5th 818, 844, 308 CR3d 645, 666 (but declining to reverse because trial court proceeded immediately to merits of § 1008 motion and denied it)] FORM: Motion for Reconsideration and Proposed Order, see Form 9A:17 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).➪ [9:324a] PRACTICE POINTER: A motion for reconsideration is often an uphill battle because you have to persuade the judge that there has been a change in the law or there are new facts, not previously available, which require a different result. There is also a higher than normal risk of sanctions on such motions, in part because contempt sanctions are expressly authorized under § 1008(d). Therefore, ensure the judge understands why you could not have discovered the new facts or law during the original motion.(1) [9:324.1] What constitutes “motion for reconsideration”: The name of the motion is not controlling. The above requirements (¶ 9:324) apply to any motion that asks the judge to decide the same matter previously ruled on. [See R & B Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2006) 140 CA4th 327, 373, 44 CR3d 426, 463 (citing text); Powell v. County of Orange (2011) 197 CA4th 1573, 1577, 129 CR3d 380, 383 (citing text); Lennar Homes of Calif., Inc. v. Stephens (2014) 232 CA4th 673, 681-682, 181 CR3d 638, 645-646](a) Application[9:324.2] A motion for summary judgment or adjudication is not a CCP § 1008 motion for reconsideration of an earlier demurrer that raised the same issue but was overruled. A trial court is not prevented in a motion for summary judgment/adjudication from revisiting issues of law previously raised on demurrer. [California Pub. Records Research, Inc. v. County of Yolo (2016) 4 CA5th 150, 189, 209 CR3d 26, 56]• [9:324.2a] Judge A issued an order staying the action. Judge B subsequently set the case for trial (implicitly revoking the stay order). Judge B’s order was invalid because not made pursuant to CCP § 1008 procedures governing motion for reconsideration. [Morite of Calif. v. Sup.Ct. (Grayson) (1993) 19 CA4th 485, 490, 23 CR2d 666, 669]• [9:324.2b] A demurrer to a cause of action as to which an earlier demurrer was overruled is in effect a motion for reconsideration of the earlier demurrer ruling, and therefore subject to CCP § 1008. [Bennett v. Suncloud (1997) 56 CA4th 91, 96, 65 CR2d 80, 83, fn. 1; see ¶ 7:140]• [9:324.2c] Judge A issued minute orders denying access to court reporter transcripts of involuntary conservatorship proceedings, following the District Attorney’s informal request to the court reporter and a newspaper’s two sentence letter request to the court clerk. After reassignment, Judge B heard a formal “motion for reconsideration” and granted access to the transcripts. CCP § 1008 did not preclude this ruling, since the original orders “were not the result of a motion process involving submission of formal requests to the court upon noticed motions supported by appropriate points and authorities and declarations” and thus did not seek modification or revocation of an order that had resulted from “an application for an order … made … to a court.” [Sorenson v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2013) 219 CA4th 409, 420-421, 161 CR3d 794, 803-804 & fn. 13]• [9:324.2d] Judge granted an anti-SLAPP motion as to all Ds. P filed a “Motion to Request Ruling on or Clarification of (the Prior Order).” Despite its name, the motion was a motion for reconsideration, as it was “largely a vehicle for rehashing and expanding arguments previously made, and citing authority that either was, or could have been, presented to the trial court previously.” [Lennar Homes of Calif., Inc. v. Stephens, supra, 232 CA4th at 681-682, 181 CR3d at 645-646 & fn. 7][9:324.2e] Reserved.(b) [9:324.2f] Compare—motion for relief under CCP § 473(b): Section 1008 deals with the general subject of motions to reconsider previous orders and renewals of previous motions. CCP § 473(b) governs applications for relief from a default or default judgment entered as a result of “mistake, surprise, inadvertence or excusable neglect.” [Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC (2015) 61 C4th 830, 838, 189 CR3d 824, 830]1) [9:324.2g] Renewed motion for CCP § 473(b) relief: If a CCP § 473(b) motion for relief from default is denied, a renewed motion for relief must meet the requirements of CCP § 1008(b). Rationale: “Section 1008 expressly applies to all renewed applications for orders the court has previously refused.” [Even Zohar Const. & Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC, supra, 61 C4th at 842, 189 CR3d at 832 (disapproving contrary authority)—second § 473(b) motion properly denied where attorney affidavit of fault failed to show new or different information as required by § 1008; see also ¶ 5:414.5](2) [9:324.3] Same judge or court: The statute says the motion may be addressed to the “same judge or court” that made the order. [CCP § 1008(a)](a) [9:324.4] “Or court”: The words “or court” mean simply that if the original judge is unavailable, another judge of the same court can hear a motion for reconsideration. There was no legislative intent to overrule earlier case law holding the motion must be addressed to the same judge if available: “[O]ne trial court judge may not reconsider and overrule a ruling by another trial court judge.” [Davcon, Inc. v. Roberts & Morgan (2003) 110 CA4th 1355, 1361, 2 CR3d 782, 788; International Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Rhone-Poulenc Basic Chemicals Co.) (1998) 62 CA4th 784, 786, 72 CR2d 849, 850, fn. 2—where first judge unavailable due to retirement, new judge authorized to rule on reconsideration motion; Marriage of Oliverez (2015) 238 CA4th 1242, 1247-1249, 190 CR3d 436, 439-444](3) [9:325] 10-day time limit: A formal notice of ruling (see ¶ 9:320) is required to set the time limit running on a motion for reconsideration. The 10-day time limit runs from service of notice of entry of the order. [CCP § 1008(a); Forrest v. State of Calif. Dept. of Corps. (2007) 150 CA4th 183, 203, 58 CR3d 466, 481 (disapproved on other grounds by Shalant v. Girardi (2011) 51 C4th 1164, 1172, 126 CR3d 98, 103, fn. 3); Novak v. Fay (2015) 236 CA4th 329, 335-336, 186 CR3d 451, 456—10-day limit did not apply where no notice of entry of order served](a) [9:326] Effect of waiver of notice? The wording of the statute suggests there is no time limit when notice is waived. But this seems contrary to the statutory purpose, and judges may therefore hold the 10-day period runs from the date of waiver. (In any case, the longer the delay, the less receptive the court may be to the motion.)(b) [9:326.1] Extension of time for service by mail or other means: The 10-day deadline for seeking reconsideration is extended under CCP § 1013 for service by mail, fax, electronic service or overnight delivery (see ¶ 9:87.1 ff.), which applies “in the absence of a specific exception provided for by this section or other statute or rule of court.” [CCP § 1013(a), (c), (e)]Some pre-1995 cases held that CCP § 1013 was not intended to apply to “jurisdictional deadlines,” similar to notices of appeal. However, CCP § 1013 was amended in 1995 to clarify that the extension of time provided by the statute applies “in the absence of a specific exception provided for by this section or other statute or rule of court.” [CCP § 1013; Stats. 1995, Ch. 576, § 3.8; see California Business Council for Equal Opportunity v. Sup.Ct. (Wilson) (1997) 52 CA4th 1100, 1107, 62 CR2d 7, 13]Because CCP § 1008 does not contain an express exception, the extensions provided by § 1013 apply to motions under § 1008.[9:326.2 - 9:326.4] Reserved.(c) [9:326.5] Compare—nonparty not subject to deadline: News Organization, a nonparty to the original proceedings, brought a motion for reconsideration of an order to seal court records entered six years earlier. News Organization’s motion was timely because, since it was not a party to the original proceedings, it was never served with notice of entry of the challenged order. Thus, the 10-day period had not commenced running at the time News Organization made its motion. [Wilson v. Science Applications Int’l Corp. (1997) 52 CA4th 1025, 1033, 60 CR2d 883, 887](d) [9:326.6] Compare—reconsideration of summary judgment motion: Even though based on new evidence, reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment could not be sought on the 10-day notice period of a CCP § 1008 motion because that would bypass the procedural protections of CCP § 437c afforded to parties opposing summary judgment, such as requiring 81 days’ notice. [Torres v. Design Group Facility Solutions, Inc. (2020) 45 CA5th 239, 243, 258 CR3d 541, 544 (construing prior version of statute); CCP § 437c(a)(2) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see ¶ 10:373.4a](4) [9:327] Reconsideration after 10 days under court’s inherent power: Although parties may move for reconsideration only as authorized by § 1008, that statute “does not limit the court’s ability, on its own motion, to reconsider its prior interim orders so it may correct its own errors.” [Le Francois v. Goel (2005) 35 C4th 1094, 1107, 29 CR3d 249, 260; see Pinela v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 CA4th 227, 237, 190 CR3d 159, 168; Boschetti v. Pacific Bay Investments Inc. (2019) 32 CA5th 1059, 1070, 244 CR3d 480, 488—terms of CCP § 1008 do not limit court’s ability to reconsider][9:327.1 - 9:327.4] Reserved.(a) [9:327.5] Court must act sua sponte: The court must act on its own motion, either as the result of its own second thoughts or in response to a party’s request (¶ 9:327.6 ff.). [Le Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 C4th at 1108, 29 CR3d at 261]Thus, in spite of the fact that a motion to reconsider is filed in violation of § 1008, the court has inherent power to correct its own errors when they are called to the court’s attention by way of an improperly filed motion. [Marriage of Barthold (2008) 158 CA4th 1301, 1308, 70 CR3d 691, 695; see also Marriage of Herr (2009) 174 CA4th 1463, 1468-1470, 95 CR3d 464, 469-470; Nieto v. Blue Shield of Calif. Life & Health Ins. Co. (2010) 181 CA4th 60, 73, 103 CR3d 906, 916-917] And prompted by arguments on a related motion, the court may on its own decide to reconsider an earlier motion. [Boschetti v. Pacific Bay Investments Inc. (2019) 32 CA5th 1059, 1070, 244 CR3d 480, 488]1) [9:327.5a] Must be based on evidence originally submitted: To grant reconsideration on its own motion, the trial court must conclude its earlier ruling was wrong “based on the evidence originally submitted,” not based on new evidence. [Marriage of Ankola (2020) 53 CA5th 369, 383, 267 CR3d 569, 579-580 (emphasis in original; internal quotes omitted)—to reconsider based on evidence not presented at earlier hearing is equivalent to granting new trial sua sponte, which court cannot do; see ¶ 9:327.11](b) [9:327.6] Manner of request: It is not improper for a party to ask the court informally (e.g., at a status conference) to reconsider an earlier ruling as long as opposing counsel is present (ex parte communication with the court is improper). [Le Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 C4th at 1108, 29 CR3d at 261 (citing text)]1) [9:327.7] Motion asking court to reconsider improper: A party’s motion asking the court to reconsider a ruling on its own motion after the 10-day period is ineffective. The court is not obliged to rule on it and opposing counsel need not respond. [Le Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 C4th at 1108, 29 CR3d at 261; Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Sup.Ct. (Wilson) (2013) 218 CA4th 96, 102, 159 CR3d 580, 586, fn. 10]➪ [9:327.8] PRACTICE POINTER: Absent changed facts or circumstances, do not make a formal motion to reconsider. The judge may impose sanctions for an improper motion (see ¶ 9:333). The best approach is to follow Le Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 C4th at 1108, 29 CR3d at 261, and make an oral suggestion (in the presence of opposing counsel) that the court reconsider its prior ruling.[9:327.9] Reserved.(c) [9:327.10] Notice and hearing required: Before reconsidering an earlier ruling on its own motion, the court must notify the parties that it may do so, solicit briefing and conduct a hearing. [Le Francois v. Goel, supra, 35 C4th at 1108, 29 CR3d at 261; see Paramount Petroleum Corp. v. Sup.Ct.(Building Materials Corp. of America) (2014) 227 CA4th 226, 238, 173 CR3d 518, 528](d) [9:327.11] Compare—no inherent power to grant new trial: In contrast to grants of reconsideration, courts have no inherent power to grant a new trial. Thus, the court cannot sua sponte reject evidence adduced at a hearing and order the parties to submit new evidence. “Whatever the court called it, the order was for a new trial.” [Marriage of Herr, supra, 174 CA4th at 1470-1471, 95 CR3d at 470-471; Marriage of Ankola, supra, 53 CA5th at 383, 267 CR3d at 579-580](e) [9:327.12] Compare—no power to reconsider after appeal filed: If an appeal is perfected, the trial court “loses subject matter jurisdiction over any matter affected by the appeal.” But the parties’ filing of a writ petition or the court of appeal’s issuing an order to show cause does not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to reconsider or change its ruling under review (absent issuance of a stay). [Paul Blanco’s Good Car Co. Auto Group v. Sup.Ct. (People) (2020) 56 CA5th 86, 97-98, 270 CR3d 164, 171; Jack v. Ring LLC (2023) 91 CA5th 1186, 1211, 309 CR3d 130, 150—trial court lacked jurisdiction to decide motion for reconsideration because motion sought to vacate and modify the order being appealed](5) [9:328] “New or different facts, circumstances or law”: The legislative intent was to restrict motions for reconsideration to circumstances where a party offers the court some fact or circumstance not previously considered, and some valid reason for not offering it earlier. [Gilberd v. AC Transit (1995) 32 CA4th 1494, 1500, 38 CR2d 626, 629-630; Mink v. Sup.Ct. (Arnel Develop. Co., Inc.) (1992) 2 CA4th 1338, 1342, 4 CR2d 195, 197; Baldwin v. Home Sav. of America (1997) 59 CA4th 1192, 1198, 69 CR2d 592, 597]The burden under § 1008 “is comparable to that of a party seeking a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence: the information must be such that the moving party could not, with reasonable diligence, have discovered or produced it at the trial.” [New York Times Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Wall St. Network, Ltd.) (2005) 135 CA4th 206, 212-213, 37 CR3d 338, 343 (emphasis added)](a) [9:329] Reasonable diligence required: A party seeking reconsideration of a prior order based on “new or different facts, circumstances or law” must provide a satisfactory explanation for failing to present the information at the first hearing; i.e., a showing of reasonable diligence.

[Hollister v. Benzl (1999) 71 CA4th 582, 585, 83 CR2d 903, 904]• [9:329.2] “New circumstances” were shown by evidence the court failed to consider a timely-filed memorandum of points and authorities in its prior ruling. [Johnston v. Corrigan (2005) 127 CA4th 553, 556, 25 CR3d 657, 659 (citing text)][9:330] Reserved.• [9:330.1] A later-enacted statute that is not retroactive does not constitute a “new or different law” under § 1008. [See CCP § 1008(f)]• [9:330.2] Reconsideration cannot be granted based on claims the court misinterpreted the law in its initial ruling (as opposed to a change in the law in the interim). That is not a “new” or “different” matter. [Gilberd v. AC Transit, supra, 32 CA4th at 1500, 38 CR2d at 630]• [9:330.3] Reconsideration cannot be granted based on the moving party’s claims that it had not intended to waive oral argument on the initial motion. Again, that is not a “new” or “different” matter. [Gilberd v. AC Transit, supra, 32 CA4th at 1500, 38 CR2d at 630]• [9:330.4] Lack of a chance for oral argument is “clearly collateral to the merits” and therefore not ground for reconsideration. [Garcia v. Hejmadi, supra, 58 CA4th at 691, 68 CR2d at 238-239]• [9:330.5] Counsel’s mistake based on ignorance of the law is not a proper basis for reconsideration. [Pazderka v. Caballeros Dimas Alang, Inc. (1998) 62 CA4th 658, 670, 73 CR2d 242, 248]• [9:330.6] A motion for reconsideration was properly denied where based on evidence that could have been presented in connection with the original motion.

White (2011) 199 CA4th 395, 406, 130 CR3d 856, 865]• [9:330.7] Deposition testimony obtained after a motion for summary judgment was granted was not ground for reconsideration where there was no showing why the deposition could not have been taken earlier. [Jones v. P.S. Develop. Co., Inc. (2008) 166 CA4th 707, 725, 82 CR3d 882, 900 (disapproved on other grounds by Reid v. Google, Inc. (2010) 50 C4th 512, 532, 113 CR3d 327, 343, fn. 7)]• [9:330.8] When an order is based on a case that is later depublished, reconsideration is proper because depublication constitutes a change in the law under § 1008. [Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Sup.Ct. (Wilson) (2013) 218 CA4th 96, 108-112, 159 CR3d 580, 590-593—“When a court decision is made on the basis of an opinion that is subsequently depublished, the law justifying that decision has necessarily changed”](6) [9:331] Declaration required: The motion for reconsideration must be accompanied by an affidavit (declaration) from the moving party stating:— what application was made previously;— when and to what judge the application was made;— what order or decisions were made; and— what new or different facts, circumstances or law are claimed to be shown. [CCP § 1008(a); see Branner v. Regents of Univ. of Calif.

Conversely, where the requirements are met, reconsideration should be granted. That does not mean, however, that the court must change its mind. Upon reconsideration, it may simply reaffirm its original order. [Corns v. Miller (1986) 181 CA3d 195, 202, 226 CR 247, 251; Blake v.

Once a judgment or order having the effect of a judgment is entered, the court loses jurisdiction to rule on a motion for reconsideration (see ¶ 9:332.1). Therefore, a postjudgment motion for reconsideration does not extend the time to appeal from the judgment. [Passavanti v. Williams (1990) 225 CA3d 1602, 1605-1606, 275 CR 887, 889-890; APRI Ins.

Since a motion for reconsideration is not such a proceeding, it does not extend the time to appeal the order. [Passavanti v. Williams, supra, 225 CA3d at 1607-1608, 275 CR at 890-891; Crotty v.

Sup.Ct.(Building Materials Corp. of America) (2014) 227 CA4th 226, 238, 173 CR3d 518, 528-529](11) [9:336.1] Denial of motion for reconsideration not separately appealable: The denial of a motion for reconsideration itself is not separately appealable. However, if the order that was the subject of the reconsideration motion is appealable, denial of the reconsideration motion is reviewable on appeal of the underlying order. [CCP § 1008(g)]d. [9:337] Renewal motions: When a motion has been denied in whole or in part, the moving party (only) may apply again for the same relief at a later time, but only on the following conditions:• The motion must be based on “new or different facts, circumstances or law” (¶ 9:340);• The motion must be supported by declaration showing the previous order, by which judge it was made, and what new or different facts, circumstances or law are claimed to exist (¶ 9:341). [CCP § 1008(b); see Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 CA3d 965, 969-970, 180 CR 604, 607-608]FORM: Renewal Motion and Proposed Order, see Form 9A:17.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:338] Exception for denials “without prejudice”? The denial of a motion “without prejudice” evidences the court’s intent to allow the motion to be renewed at a later time, potentially without the necessity of showing new facts. However, CCP § 1008(b) creates no exception for such orders. Thus, the effect of a “without prejudice” denial is unclear given the jurisdictional nature of § 1008.Comment: The phrase “without prejudice” is often used to mean the matter is not ripe, such as an issue that should be raised later in a motion in limine. Use of “without prejudice” in this type of situation might be harmful. For example, where an appealable order is denied “without prejudice” and then renewed after the time for appeal has passed, it is possible that no timely appeal could thereafter be filed.[9:338.1 - 9:338.4] Reserved.(2) [9:338.5] No time limit: Unlike a motion for reconsideration, there is no time limit under § 1008 for the renewal of a previous motion. [See CCP § 1008(b), (e); Stephen v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car of San Francisco (1991) 235 CA3d 806, 816, 1 CR2d 130, 136](3) [9:339] Different judge: Unlike a motion for reconsideration, which must be heard by the same judge, a different judge may hear the renewal motion. [Deauville Restaurant, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Taylor) (2001) 90 CA4th 843, 849-851, 108 CR2d 863, 867-869]But the supporting declaration must disclose the prior motion, its resolution and the judge who heard it. [CCP § 1008(b)](a) [9:339.1] Comment: Because a renewed motion is based on, e.g., different facts or law, it does not technically seek to have the original order reversed. Nevertheless, judges do not like to change the effect of other judges’ orders, and some judges routinely transfer renewal motions to the judge who heard the matter originally.[9:339.2 - 9:339.4] Reserved.(4) [9:339.5] “Same order” means same relief sought: An “application for the same order” as used in CCP § 1008(b) means a motion seeking the same relief as in an earlier motion. [California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 CA4th 30, 43, 103 CR3d 699, 711; see Randy’s Trucking, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Buttram) (2023) 91 CA5th 818, 846, 308 CR3d 645, 667-668]• [9:339.6] After an earlier motion for attorney fees under a state statute was denied, D moved for the identical relief under a federal statute. Although different grounds were asserted, the second motion was subject to CCP § 1008(b)’s reasonable diligence requirement (¶ 9:329): “Defendants may not make seriatim motions that seek the same relief; rather Defendants were obligated to put forth all of their reasons for an award of attorneys’ fees when they made their initial request.” [California Correctional Peace Officers Ass’n v. Virga (2010) 181 CA4th 30, 45, 103 CR3d 699, 712-713 (emphasis in original)](5) [9:340] “New or different facts, circumstances or law”: This terminology gives the court very broad power. [Farmers Ins. Exchange v. Sup.Ct. (Wilson) (2013) 218 CA4th 96, 106-107, 159 CR3d 580, 589 (citing text)]There is no real limit on what the court may consider except that:— it may not consider matters presented at the earlier hearing (such matters are neither “new” nor “different”); and— a later-enacted statute that is not retroactive does not constitute a “new or different law” (see CCP § 1008(f)).(a) Application• [9:340.1] D renewed a motion for summary judgment almost one year after the court had denied its earlier motion. D disclosed the earlier rulings and showed recent deposition admissions by P, which constituted “new facts.” The renewed motion was properly granted. [Graham v. Hansen (1982) 128 CA3d 965, 971, 180 CR 604, 608]• [9:340.2] P renewed its application for a right to attach order several months after its earlier application had been denied. A full showing of the facts was made at the time of the original application. Hence, there were no “new facts.” But depositions obtained during the interim explained the meaning of the facts: “Nothing truly new is offered in terms of substantive facts … [but] there are many subtle nuances and subjective impressions … none of which could be read from the earlier declarations.” Based thereon, it was proper for the court to grant the second application. [Film Packages v. Brandywine Film Productions, Ltd. (1987) 193 CA3d 824, 827, 238 CR 623, 625, fn. 3 (emphasis added)]• [9:340.3] D’s motion to compel arbitration of a consumer class action was denied on the ground that, under California law, the class action waivers in the underlying consumer contracts were unenforceable. Three years later, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Federal Arbitration Act preempted California’s rule and that class action waivers in consumer contracts provisions are enforceable. This intervening change in law permitted the trial court to revisit its prior order and issue a new order compelling arbitration. [Phillips v. Sprint PCS (2012) 209 CA4th 758, 768-769, 147 CR3d 274, 281-282][9:340.4] Reserved.(b) [9:340.5] Exception for later-enacted statutes: Later-enacted statutes are not “new or different” laws if not retroactive in effect. [CCP § 1008(f)]Comment: Few statutes contain express nonretroactivity clauses. Thus, until a case determines a new law to be nonretroactive, that law may be ground for reconsideration or renewal of motions.However, unless the language of the statute or the legislative history indicates otherwise, statutes are presumed to operate only prospectively. [Smart Corner Owners Ass’n v. CJUF Smart Corner LLC (2021) 64 CA5th 439, 458, 279 CR3d 11, 25; see McHugh v. Protective Life Ins. Co. (2021) 12 C5th 213, 228-230, 283 CR3d 323, 333-335—statutes operate prospectively unless they change legal consequences of past conduct by imposing new or different liabilities on conduct](c) [9:340.6] Effect of judicial decisions: By contrast to later-enacted statutes, “[o]rdinarily, judicial decisions apply retrospectively … Although prospective application may be appropriate in some circumstances when our decision alters a settled rule upon which parties justifiably relied, ordinarily this is only when a decision constitutes a clear break with decisions of this court or with practices we have sanctioned by implication, or when we disapprove[] a longstanding and widespread practice expressly approved by a near-unanimous body of lower-court authorities.” [Grafton Partners L.P. v. Sup.Ct. (PriceWaterhouseCoopers L.L.P.) (2005) 36 C4th 944, 967, 32 CR3d 5, 20-21 (emphasis and second brackets in original; internal quotes omitted); Frlekin v. Apple Inc. (2020) 8 C5th 1038, 1057, 258 CR3d 392, 407]Comment: Even if a new appellate opinion does not technically qualify as a new law, it may sufficiently clarify the law as to qualify as a new circumstance, counseling a trial judge to revisit the ruling in question.(6) [9:341] Declaration required: The renewal motion must be supported by an affidavit (declaration) stating:— what motion or application was previously made;— when it was made;— the judge before whom it was made;— what order or decision was then made; and— what new or different facts, circumstances or law are claimed to exist. [CCP § 1008(b)](7) [9:342] Effect of failure to comply: If the statutory requirements above (¶ 9:341) are not met, the renewal motion must be denied. If for any reason an order granting relief is made, that order may be revoked on ex parte application. [CCP § 1008(b)](8) [9:343] Contempt and sanctions: As with motions for reconsideration, violations of CCP § 1008 may be punished as a contempt of court. [CCP § 1008(d)]In addition, where the motion violates the attorney’s certificate of merit under CCP § 128.7, sanctions may be imposed. [CCP § 1008(d)][9:344 - 9:344.19] Reserved. 5. [9:344.20] Enforcement of Sanctions Orders: A sanctions order is enforceable in the same way as a “money judgment”: i.e., a writ of execution may be issued and levied on the property of the person sanctioned. [See CCP §§ 680.230, 680.270, 699.510; Newland v. Sup.Ct. (Sugasawara) (1995) 40 CA4th 608, 615, 47 CR2d 24, 28 (citing text)]Because sanctions orders have the force and effect of a money judgment, the court may include a sanctions award directly into the judgment at the conclusion of the case. [Constellation-F, LLC v. World Trading 23, Inc. (2020) 45 CA5th 22, 30-31, 258 CR3d 341, 346-347]a. [9:344.21] Comment: Many attorneys seem unaware that a sanctions order can be enforced by execution. Some request instead that the sanctioned party be held in contempt for failure to pay. Most judges prefer that the execution procedures be used, and will refuse to entertain contempt proceedings for collection purposes (at least until after execution has been attempted).➪ [9:344.22] PRACTICE POINTER: Another possibility is to obtain and record an abstract of judgment, creating a judgment lien on the sanctioned party’s or counsel’s home or other real property. To obtain an abstract of judgment, a specific order directing issuance of a judgment is required in some courts (to prevent harassing opposing parties in situations in which the sanctions are likely to be paid).Cross-refer: For detailed discussion of writs of execution and judgment liens, see Ahart, Cal. Prac. Guide: Enforcing Judgments & Debts (TRG), Ch. 6.[9:344.23 - 9:344.24] Reserved. 6. [9:344.25] Appellate Review: Law and motion rulings are generally not appealable orders, but the losing party may seek appellate review by petition for extraordinary writ (e.g., mandamus or prohibition). However, appellate courts deny such petitions in the vast majority of cases.Cross-refer: For detailed discussion of extraordinary writs, see Eisenberg, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Appeals & Writs (TRG), Ch. 15.➪ [9:344.26] PRACTICE POINTER: To enhance prospects for appellate review, the losing party should ask the trial court to include in its order a statement to the effect that “there is a controlling question of law as to which there are substantial grounds for difference of opinion, appellate resolution of which may materially advance the conclusion of the litigation” (see CCP § 166.1). © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[9:345] Judicial Policy re Ex Parte Applications: In this context “ex parte” motions are those heard on shortened time. Due process requires adequate notice and opportunity to be heard on any motion that affects the rights of the opposing party (see ¶ 9:349). Some statutes require fully noticed motions (e.g., 16 court days notice, see ¶ 9:87 ff.), which may be shortened on a showing of “good cause” (see ¶ 9:364). In other situations, due process is met by giving ex parte notice on shortened time (see ¶ 9:347 ff.). There are rare exceptions to these notice requirements, where, e.g., great or irreparable harm might result if notice were given (see, e.g., ¶ 9:699).Judges are usually reluctant to act on shortened notice in civil actions. There is always a concern that the opposing party has not had an adequate opportunity to present evidence and argument and the court does not have all the facts. In doubtful cases, the court usually will require the matter to be presented on statutory notice.➪ [9:346] PRACTICE POINTER: In view of this policy, don’t ask a judge for an ex parte order unless it is clear that such relief is proper. If there are any serious factual issues involved, don’t expect the court to resolve them ex parte. You’ll save a lot of time and effort by avoiding ex parte applications and filing a noticed motion. [People ex rel. Allstate Ins. Co. v. Suh (2019) 37 CA5th 253, 257, 249 CR3d 500, 503 (citing text)]a. [9:346.1] Standards for professionalism: Some courts have adopted the following guidelines as “civility in litigation recommendations to members of the bar”:• “Even where applicable laws or rules permit an ex parte application or communication to the Court … a lawyer should make diligent efforts to notify the opposing party … and should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the schedule of such lawyer to permit the opposing party to be represented on the application.” [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(j)(2) (2nd emphasis added)]• “Where the Rules permit an ex parte application or communication to the Court in an emergency situation, a lawyer should make such an application or communication (including an application to shorten an otherwise applicable time period) only where there is a bona fide emergency such that the lawyer’s client will be seriously prejudiced by a failure to make the application or communication on regular notice.” [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(j)(3) (emphasis added)] 2. [9:347] When Proper: Only limited forms of relief are available ex parte. For the most part, these are authorized by statutes. (Very few statutes actually use the term “ex parte” relief; most authorize relief “upon application” or “for good cause shown.”) The following are the most common situations in which ex parte orders may be obtained:• to shorten or extend time to plead or for service of notice;• to appoint a guardian ad litem;• to amend a pleading by substituting the name of a fictitiously-named party (¶ 6:612 ff.);• to amend a pleading by adding or deleting parties, or correcting a mistake in a party’s name or in any other respect (¶ 6:618 ff.);• to authorize service by publication (¶ 4:247) or substitute service on a corporation;• to exceed page limits for memoranda of law (e.g., CRC 3.1113(e));• to authorize discovery by plaintiff during the “hold” on discovery at the outset of the case (see CCP §§ 2025.210(b), 2030.020(b), (d); and ¶ 8:444);• to control deposition scheduling (CCP § 2025.270; see ¶ 8:493.3);(Caution: Most other orders extending or shortening time for discovery require a noticed motion; see ¶ 9:349.1.) • dismissal for failure to amend complaint after demurrer sustained (CCP § 581(f)(2); CRC 3.1320(h); see ¶ 11:277.3).a. [9:348] Not where statute requires notice: Statutes affording relief upon “notice” or a “noticed motion” are not the proper subject of an ex parte application and cannot be satisfied by compliance with CRC 3.1200’s notice requirements for ex parte relief.➪ [9:348.1] PRACTICE POINTER: No matter how dire the emergency, the court cannot grant ex parte relief where a statute requires a noticed motion. The court can, however, shorten the amount of notice required for hearing the motion; see ¶ 9:364.b. [9:349] Compare—statutes not specifically requiring notice; due process limitation: Many statutes refer only to an “application” or a “motion” and do not specifically require notice of hearing. Even so, courts may not grant ex parte relief that would affect the opposing party’s rights: “The general rule is that notice of motion must be given whenever the order sought may affect the rights of an adverse party.” [McDonald v. Severy (1936) 6 C2d 629, 631, 59 P2d 98, 99 (emphasis added)]In such cases, therefore, a statute silent on the question of notice will not be interpreted to permit ex parte relief. Rather, use of the term “motion” rather than “ex parte application” implies that regular notice and hearing requirements are generally applicable to motions. [St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Borak) (1984) 156 CA3d 82, 86, 202 CR 571, 573 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 983, 90 CR2d 260, 267, fn. 12)](1) [9:349.1] Application: Thus, for example, regular notice requirements apply to motions:— to extend the time to plead after it has already expired (see ¶ 6:386);— to shorten or extend the time for responding to discovery requests (e.g., interrogatories, RFAs, and demands for documents) (see CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2031.260(a), 2033.250(a));— to permit discovery after the discovery “cut-off” date (CCP § 2024.050);— for a protective order to terminate deposition (St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Borak), supra, 156 CA3d at 86, 202 CR at 573);— to certify a class action (Carabini v. Sup.Ct. (King) (1994) 26 CA4th 239, 243, 31 CR2d 520, 523);— to obtain discovery while an anti-SLAPP motion is pending (CCP § 425.16(g)).(2) [9:349.2] Compare—where opposing party’s rights not affected: But ex parte relief may be allowed where the motion has no effect on the opposing party’s rights or liability. For example, a motion:— to substitute parties on death or transfer of interest of one of the original parties. [CCP § 377.33; see ¶ 2:500 ff.] 3. [9:350] Procedure: Before presentation to the court, the application must be filed in the court clerk’s office and appropriate filing fees paid.In cases assigned to an independent calendar judge, it may be necessary to contact that judge’s clerk to schedule a hearing.Some courts have local rules governing ex parte application forms and procedures and scheduling of such matters. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.5; S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 9.0] (Although CRC 3.20 preempts local rules relating to ex parte matters, rules that “relate only to the internal management of the court” are not affected; see CRC 10.613.)a. [9:351] Notice requirement: No application for ex parte relief may be made unless the applicant provides a declaration showing compliance with the notice requirements of CRC 3.1204. [See CRC 3.1204(b)](1) [9:351.1] Distinguish—statutory notice requirements: Do not confuse the above (¶ 9:351) with statutory notice requirements. Where statutes require that a motion be made “upon notice,” it cannot be granted ex parte. The notification to opposing counsel described below (¶ 9:352 ff.) is not the equivalent of statutory notice (¶ 9:348).(2) [9:352] Minimum notice: Absent a showing of exceptional circumstances, the applicant is required to give all other parties notice no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte appearance. [CRC 3.1203(a)]If the party has not yet appeared in the action through counsel, notice must be given to the party directly. [Newsom v. Sup.Ct. (Gallagher) (2020) 51 CA5th 1093, 1099, 265 CR3d 582, 586]Exception—unlawful detainer proceedings: A party seeking an ex parte order in an unlawful detainer proceeding may provide shorter notice; the notice given need only be “reasonable.” [CRC 3.1203(b)](3) [9:353] Content of notice: The person giving notice is required to state with specificity the nature of the relief to be requested and the date, time and place the application will be made. [CRC 3.1204(a)(1)]The person giving notice must also “attempt to determine” whether the opposing party and/or counsel will appear to oppose the ex parte application. [CRC 3.1204(a)(2)]The notice procedures are “designed to ensure the participation, if possible, of the opposing party.” [Newsom v. Sup.Ct. (Gallagher), supra, 51 CA5th at 1099, 265 CR3d at 586](4) [9:353.1] Form of notice: The notification may be either in writing or oral. The manner of notice must be disclosed in the declaration of notice (¶ 9:357 ff.).➪ [9:353.2] PRACTICE POINTER: Where permitted or required, use electronic service (¶ 9:86.25 ff.) or fax service (¶ 9:86.10 ff.).(5) [9:354] Parties to be notified: Notice must be given to all parties (not just opposing parties). [CRC 3.1203(a)][9:354.1 - 9:354.4] Reserved.(6) [9:354.5] Compare—statutes excusing notice: Although the matter is unclear, CRC 3.1203-3.1204 apparently do not apply where statutes authorize court orders without notice to the opposing party:(a) [9:354.6] Minor amendments to pleadings; extensions of time to plead: CCP § 473(a)(1) authorizes courts to:— enlarge the time for answer or demurrer; or— allow minor amendments to a party’s pleadings (“by adding or striking out the name of any party, or by correcting a mistake in the name of a party, or a mistake in any other respect”) (e.g., “Doe” amendments).Although the statute does not expressly state such relief may be granted without notice to the adverse party, that is implicit in the statute’s requirement for notice for other amendments to the pleadings and for orders allowing tardy answers. [See CCP § 473(a)(1), 2nd sent.](b) [9:354.7] Dismissal following failure to amend: CCP § 581(f)(2) authorizes dismissal without a noticed motion where, after a demurrer is sustained with leave to amend, plaintiff fails to amend within the permitted time (see ¶ 11:277.3). However, the CRC 3.1203 requirement of ex parte notice to opposing counsel before making an ex parte application to the court does apply. [Datig v. Dove Books, Inc. (1999) 73 CA4th 964, 977, 87 CR2d 719, 728-729 (superseded by rule on other grounds)](c) [9:354.8] Application for appointment of guardian ad litem: Notice of a guardian ad litem application is not required in most circumstances. [See Alex R. v. Sup.Ct. (Mirian R.) (2016) 248 CA4th 1, 8-9, 203 CR3d 251, 255-256][9:354.9] Reserved.(7) [9:354.10] Compare—OSCs: In the past, courts routinely granted ex parte applications for OSCs without advance notification to opposing counsel. However, this is apparently no longer permissible; CRC 3.1203 apparently requires advance notice to opposing counsel even where the only “relief” sought is setting a hearing date on an OSC. (Such relief may be obtained without a personal appearance, however; see ¶ 9:370.6.)b. [9:355] Form of application: Ex parte applications must be in writing and include all of the following:• Application: An application containing the case caption and stating the relief requested (¶ 9:356);• Declaration showing factual basis for emergency or other statutory basis for ex parte relief (see ¶ 9:358 ff.);• Declaration of notice (which may be combined with the declaration showing cause for ex parte relief) (see ¶ 9:357);• Points and authorities; and• Proposed order. [CRC 3.1201]➪ [9:355.1] PRACTICE POINTER: It is common practice to combine the application and declarations.FORM: Ex Parte Applications, see Form 9A:18 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:356] Application: The request for an ex parte order must be in writing (CRC 3.1201) and conform to the form and format requirements of court papers generally (CRC 2.100 ff.).(a) [9:356.1] Identify opposing counsel/party: The application must state the name, address, email address and telephone number of any attorney known to be representing the opposing party (or the party’s name, address, email address and telephone number if there is no known attorney). [CRC 3.1202(a)](b) [9:356.2] Disclose any prior application: If the same ex parte relief was previously refused in whole or in part, the application must include a “full disclosure” of the prior application and the court’s actions thereon. [CRC 3.1202(b)](2) [9:357] Declaration of notice: An application for ex parte relief must be accompanied by a declaration of notice based on personal knowledge, setting forth:(a) [9:357.1] Attempts to inform opposing party: Within the required time (no later than 10:00 a.m., one court day before the hearing; see ¶ 9:352), the applicant either:— informed the opposing party when and where the application would be made; or— attempted in good faith to inform the opposing party but was unable to do so, specifying the efforts made to inform the opposing party; or— for reasons specified, was not required to inform the opposing party. [CRC 3.1204(b)]If notice was given later than 10:00 a.m. on the court day before the ex parte application, the declaration regarding notice must explain the exceptional circumstances that justify the shorter notice. [CRC 3.1204(c)](b) [9:357.2] Required information: The declaration must specify the date, time, manner and name of the party informed, the relief sought, any response, and whether opposition is expected (or a statement of reasons why notice should not be required, ¶ 9:357.1). [CRC 3.1204(b)]FORM: Ex Parte Application for Order Extending Time, see Form 9A:18.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). (An optional Judicial Council form can also be used for this purpose (CM-020).)➪ [9:357.3] PRACTICE POINTER: A separate declaration is not required; you can combine your declaration of notice with the required declaration showing grounds for ex parte relief (¶ 9:358).Make sure your declaration states facts, rather than mere conclusions. For example, if you are unable to reach opposing counsel, state the times of day you telephoned, with whom you spoke, what messages you left, etc. (Do not say simply, “I attempted unsuccessfully to reach opposing counsel.”)[9:357.4] Reserved.(c) [9:357.5] Clerk must accept for filing despite improper notice: The court clerk must accept an ex parte application for filing and promptly present it to the judge for consideration, notwithstanding the applicant’s failure to comply with the notice requirements above (¶ 9:357 ff.). [CRC 3.1205](3) [9:358] Declaration showing “good cause” for ex parte relief: The application for ex parte relief must be accompanied by a declaration containing an “affirmative factual showing” consisting of “competent testimony based on personal knowledge of irreparable harm, immediate danger or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte.” [CRC 3.1202(c) (emphasis added); Newsom v. Sup.Ct. (Gallagher) (2020) 50 CA5th 1093, 1097, 265 CR3d 582, 585—trial court should deny relief absent this showing, particularly when party seeks temporary restraining order on expedited basis](As stated above (¶ 9:357.3), this declaration is usually combined with the declaration of notice.)The following illustrate application of this requirement:(a) [9:359] Orders extending time: On a showing of “good cause,” the court may grant ex parte an extension of time to plead for up to an additional 30 days, without the consent of the adverse party. [CCP § 1054]1) [9:360] Requirements: The application should state the nature of the case, and a declaration filed in support of the application should state any previous extension granted (either by stipulation or court order). [CRC 2.20(b)]2) [9:361] Judicial attitude: Usually, courts are quite liberal in granting at least one extension of time to plead, etc. The “good cause” requirement is satisfied simply by statements that the attorney’s “press of business” prevents counsel from being able to prepare a response within the time required; and that an extension was refused by opposing counsel (or opposing counsel could not be reached in time, etc.).But, courts may be reluctant to extend time more than once on an ex parte basis.➪ [9:361.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Because courts liberally grant the first extension request, it is probably a waste of time and your client’s money to oppose such a request.3) [9:362] Service: If the order is granted, a copy thereof must be served on opposing counsel within 24 hours, unless the court expressly orders otherwise. [CRC 2.20(c)]4) [9:363] Limitation—no extension after time expired: Time cannot be extended after it has already expired. (No room for nunc pro tunc orders to avoid entry of default.) [See Coast Elec. Service, Inc. v. Jensen (1931) 111 CA 124, 126, 295 P 346, 347—dealing with costs memo](b) [9:364] Order shortening time: Judges are usually more cautious about shortening time for notice than about extending time. An application for an order shortening time must be supported by a declaration showing “good cause” for the order. Mere lack of time for statutory notice is not a sufficient showing. [See CRC 3.1202(c); Eliceche v. Federal Land Bank Ass’n (2002) 103 CA4th 1349, 1369, 128 CR2d 200, 216—upholding order shortening 45-day notice on CCP § 583.410 discretionary dismissal motion (discussed at ¶ 11:134 ff.)]➪ [9:365] PRACTICE POINTER: Before asking for ex parte relief, ask opposing counsel to stipulate to shortened time. If counsel refuses, you can state this fact in your application for ex parte relief, and it may help convince the judge that there is “good cause” for an order shortening time.1) [9:366] Contents of order: If such relief is granted, the order should specify:• The date, time and place of the court hearing (for which notice was shortened);Most courts are inclined to give the opposing party as much notice as reasonable under the circumstances. In some courts, hearings will not be set fewer than 7 days after the date of application unless it is shown that action sooner is necessary. • A deadline for service of copies of the moving papers and the court order shortening time; and for filing proof of such service with the clerk of the law and motion department; and• The dates by which any opposition papers and any reply papers must be filed and served for consideration at the hearing, and the manner of service. To accommodate the time pressures, frequently a reply is waived.FORM: Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time and Proposed Order, see Form 9A:18.2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).2) [9:367] Service: Service by hand, or electronically where permitted, is usually required for both the moving and responding papers.3) [9:368] Limitations: Statutes may limit the court’s power to shorten time for notice of a motion hearing:a) [9:368.1] Summary judgment or summary adjudication: The court may not shorten the 81-day notice period required on a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion. [CCP § 437c(a) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see McMahon v. Sup.Ct. (American Equity Ins. Co.) (2003) 106 CA4th 112, 115, 130 CR2d 407, 409—statutory provision allowing court to shorten time specifically applied to procedures other than notice]c. [9:369] To whom presented: If the ex parte application relates to a hearing or procedure then pending before a particular judge (e.g., in cases assigned for all purposes to an independent calendar judge), the application must be presented to that judge. [CRC 2.20(a); see Legg v. Brody (1960) 187 CA2d 79, 83, 9 CR 593, 596—order extending time obtained from different judge held “ineffective and of no force”]If the judge before whom the matter is pending is unavailable, the application should be presented to the judge assigned to hear the unavailable judge’s calendar, the supervising judge or the judge of the master calendar department, as appropriate.If the case has not been assigned to a particular judge, it may be presented to any judge of the court. In larger courts, a judge or commissioner is often regularly assigned to hear ex parte applications.➪ [9:370] PRACTICE POINTERS: The judge may have only a few moments to read your application, so make it clear and concise:• At the beginning, state (a) exactly what orders are requested; (b) the court’s legal authority for making these orders ex parte; and (c) circumstances constituting “good cause” for granting such orders.• Remember to include a proposed order (separate from the application so that it will be easy to find).• Because the court’s file may not be readily available (many are now in electronic format), consider bringing copies with you of the key documents in the file for the judge and opposing counsel.d. [9:370.1] Service of papers before hearing: The parties appearing at the ex parte hearing must serve the application (and all other required documents, see ¶ 9:355 ff.) on all other appearing parties “at the first reasonable opportunity.” Absent exceptional circumstances, no hearing will be conducted unless such service has been made. [CRC 3.1206; see Newsom v. Sup.Ct. (Gallagher) (2020) 51 CA5th 1093, 1098, 265 CR3d 582, 585-586—all ex parte papers required under CRC 3.1201 must be served, including proposed order]Some judges have rules or policies requiring ex parte papers to be served on the opposing party well before the hearing—sometimes, the day preceding the hearing. Although such rules and policies are probably preempted by CRC 3.20(a) (see ¶ 9:13.2), the safer course is to comply with them.Some e-filing procedures have deadlines for e-filing of ex parte papers. [See Los Angeles Superior Court First Amended General Order re Mandatory Electronic Filing for Civil (5/3/19), available on the court’s website (www.lacourt.org)—“8) a) Ex parte applications and all documents in support thereof must be electronically filed no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before the ex parte hearing. b) Any written opposition to an ex parte application must be electronically filed by 8:30 a.m. the day of the ex parte hearing. A printed courtesy copy of any opposition to an ex parte application must be provided to the court the day of the ex parte hearing”]If a party intends to appear remotely, the provisions of CRC 3.672 must be complied with. For an ex parte hearing with less than three court days’ notice, the moving party must provide notice of the party’s intent to appear remotely at the same time as providing notice of the application or other moving papers. [CRC 3.672(g)(2)(B)](A rule suspended until January 1, 2026 provides that if the moving party intends to appear by telephone, the papers must be served no later than 10:00 a.m. two court days before the ex parte hearing. CRC 3.670(h)(3) (suspended until 1/1/26 per CRC 3.670(b); see ¶ 9:159.2).)➪ [9:370.2] PRACTICE POINTER: The “first reasonable opportunity” contemplated by CRC 3.1206 often means serving opposing counsel at the ex parte hearing itself. Formal service (as required for noticed motions) rarely will be possible because ex parte matters typically are heard on as little as 24-hour notice (see ¶ 9:352).If there is time to get the papers to opposing counsel in advance (i.e., by email or fax), you should do it. Don’t sandbag your opponent by waiting until the matter is called before serving your papers. The judge is likely to treat this as a failure to serve before the hearing and may defer the matter.[9:370.3 - 9:370.4] Reserved.e. [9:370.5] Appearance by applicant or counsel required at hearing: Except as noted below (¶ 3:370.6), an ex parte application will not be “considered” without an appearance, either in person or remotely, by the applicant or applicant’s attorney (i.e., no sending process servers or paralegals). [See CRC 3.1207](1) [9:370.6] Exceptions: Ex parte applications will be considered without an appearance in the following cases only:— applications for extensions of time to serve pleadings;— applications to file points and authorities in excess of the applicable page limit;— setting a hearing date on an alternative writ or order to show cause; and— stipulations by the parties for a court order. [CRC 3.1207](2) [9:370.7] Effect of failure to appear: Subject to the above exceptions (¶ 9:370.6), if the applicant’s counsel fails to appear at the time specified in the notice to opposing counsel, no ex parte relief will be granted. [See CRC 3.1207]Any subsequent application for the same relief will require additional notice to opposing counsel; and should show “good cause” for the failure to appear. Moreover, sanctions and an award of fees and costs to opposing counsel may be available under CRC 2.30 after notice and an opportunity to be heard.f. [9:370.8] Ruling on application: The judge often will grant or deny the application without a formal hearing (see CCP § 166(a)(1)), sometimes by minute order. In that case, it is presumed that the court considered both the moving and opposition papers. [See Barboni v. Tuomi (2012) 210 CA4th 340, 352, 148 CR3d 581, 591—trial court’s failure to mention opposition papers in minute order did not require reversal of ex parte order: “We decline to impose on the trial bench an unduly burdensome requirement that any order issued without a hearing must specifically state that an opposition was considered”] © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[9:406.15] Ruling immediately appealable[9:371] There is a strong judicial interest in regulating who appears as attorney of record. As a practical matter, it is one of the ways the court has for retaining effective control of the case. Among other important purposes, an attorney’s appearance provides the court and parties with the name and address of the person with whom they must communicate with respect to the party represented.Some changes involving the status of counsel as attorneys of record may be made unilaterally; others require a motion. In all cases, however, the court must be apprised of the identity of all counsel of record. 1. [9:371a] Designation of Attorneys of Record: The first page of the pleadings identifies “the attorney for the party in whose behalf the paper is presented” (CRC 2.111(1)). When a law firm is listed as “attorneys of record,” the court will permit any attorney from that firm (who is a member of the California Bar) to appear for the client without the need to file an association or substitution of attorneys. [Ellis Law Group, LLP v. Nevada City Sugar Loaf Properties, LLC (2014) 230 CA4th 244, 258, 178 CR3d 490, 500-501] 2. [9:371.1] Association of Counsel: Counsel often ask other counsel to make appearances for them. If they are not members of the same law firm, a formal association of counsel is technically required. Some courts are strict in enforcing this requirement; others are not.An association of counsel constitutes a formal appearance in the action. That counsel cannot limit the effect by claiming to be appearing “specially.” This has no effect (it is a misuse of a term applicable to personal jurisdiction over parties). 3. [9:372] Changing Attorney of Record: The attorney of record for a party may be changed either by mutual consent of the party and counsel, or by court order. [CCP § 284]a. [9:373] Ethical considerations: While the client has the right to discharge the lawyer at any time, there are ethical limitations on the lawyer’s right to withdraw.The Rules of Professional Conduct (CRPC) allow a lawyer to withdraw if, among other things:• the client insists upon presenting a claim or defense in a litigation matter, or asserting a position or making a demand in a nonlitigation matter, that is not warranted and cannot be supported by good faith argument for extension, modification or reversal of the law; or• the client either seeks to pursue a criminal or fraudulent course of conduct or has used the lawyer’s services to pursue a criminal or fraudulent course of conduct; or• the client insists that the lawyer pursue a course of conduct that is criminal or fraudulent; or• the client breaches a material term of an agreement with or obligation to the lawyer regarding the representation and the lawyer gives a reasonable warning after the breach that the lawyer will withdraw unless the client fulfills the agreement or performs the obligation (e.g., pay fees or expenses); or• other conduct by the client “renders it unreasonably difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation effectively.” [CRPC 1.16(b) (emphasis added)](1) Application• [9:374] A motion to be relieved is apparently proper simply because of a personality clash with the client. The breakdown in the attorney-client relationship is ground for allowing the attorney to withdraw. [See Estate of Falco v. Decker (1987) 188 CA3d 1004, 1014, 233 CR 807, 813][9:375 - 9:377] Reserved.b. [9:378] By signed substitution of attorneys: Where the change is by consent, it can be effected at any time (even on the eve of trial, but do not expect the trial to be postponed as a result) simply by filing and serving a signed substitution of attorneys. Permission of court is not required. [CCP § 284(1); see Hock v. Sup.Ct. (Woodside Business Park) (1990) 221 CA3d 670, 671, 270 CR 579, 580 (invalidating local rule that required leave of court to substitute after trial set)]FORM: Substitution of Attorney—Civil (mandatory Judicial Council form MC-050), see Form 9A:20 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [9:379] In pro per: If a party is being substituted in propria persona, the substitution form must include the mailing address and telephone of the party.(2) [9:380] Limitation—attorney retained by guardian ad litem: The attorney of record for a minor appearing through a guardian ad litem can be substituted out in favor of other qualified counsel. But court approval is required (see ¶ 9:381). The guardian ad litem cannot be substituted in pro per because this could jeopardize the rights of the minor whom the guardian represents. [Torres v. Friedman (1985) 169 CA3d 880, 888, 215 CR 604, 609; J.W. v. Sup.Ct. (1993) 17 CA4th 958, 963-965, 22 CR2d 527, 529-530; see ¶ 2:84]c. [9:381] By court order: If mutual consent is not obtainable, a court order is required. Either the client or attorney may seek such order upon noticed motion served on the other and upon all other parties who have appeared in the case. [CCP § 284(2); CRC 3.1362]Compare—limited scope representation: Different rules apply where the attorney was retained for only a limited scope representation (e.g., to appear at a specific hearing, etc.). [CRC 3.36; see ¶ 1:192 ff.](1) [9:381.1] Opposing party’s motion to disqualify counsel: The opposing party may move to disqualify counsel for conflicts of interest based on former representation of that party, or to prevent disclosure of confidential information obtained in the course of such representation. See discussion at ¶ 9:406.5 ff.(2) [9:382] Client’s motion to discharge counsel: A party has the right to be represented by counsel of choice. Therefore, the client’s right to recuse (substitute out) existing counsel is absolute. I.e., on proper notice to the existing counsel and to all other parties, the client is entitled to a court order substituting new counsel, or substituting the client in propria persona.(a) [9:383] Client’s files: Existing counsel must turn over the client’s files to new counsel immediately. It is unethical to withhold the client’s files until fees or other disputes are settled. (See discussion at ¶ 1:449 ff.)(b) [9:384] Right to fees: Whether or not there was “cause” for discharge, the attorney is entitled to the reasonable value of services rendered before the discharge. Where the case was being handled on a contingency fee basis, such fees are payable only when the recovery is obtained. But the attorney may be given a lien on the cause of action to secure such payment. (See discussion at ¶ 1:421 ff.)(3) [9:385] Attorney’s motion to be relieved as attorney of record: If the attorney is the moving party, the right to withdraw is conditioned on proper notice and a showing of why a court order is required (i.e., why substitution by mutual consent not obtained). [CRC 3.1362]The attorney must disclose enough information to satisfy the court that grounds exists for relieving the attorney. (Grounds most often asserted are the client’s breach of the retainer agreement, the client’s refusal to follow the attorney’s advice or other conduct showing a breakdown of the attorney-client relationship.)Where the ground claimed is a “conflict of interest” with the client, the attorney must describe the general nature of the conflict as fully as possible, within the confines of the attorney-client privilege. [Manfredi & Levine v. Sup.Ct. (Barles) (1998) 66 CA4th 1128, 1134, 78 CR2d 494, 498—trial court need not accept attorney’s claim that he had received “unsolicited and confidential information” which prevented him from providing further representation to client]➪ [9:385.1] CAUTION: CRC 3.1362 contains a number of technical requirements for a motion to be relieved as counsel that are frequently overlooked, resulting in these motions having to be continued for compliance. Counsel should carefully read the rule and comply with each of its requirements when preparing the motion. Also note that counsel is not relieved as attorney of record until the order so providing has been served on the client and proof of such service has been filed with the court.(a) [9:385.2] Limitations: The court may exercise its discretion not to permit withdrawal on the eve of trial or under other circumstances that pose obvious risk of prejudice to the client.Compare—consensual substitution on eve of trial: Even a consensual substitution that would not require court approval might require explanation in light of an impending trial date. [See Filbin v. Fitzgerald (2012) 211 CA4th 154, 170, 149 CR3d 422, 435 (citing text)— judge might require “information to justify terminating the attorney-client relationship” where withdrawal hearing only 17 days before scheduled trial]1) [9:385.3] Where counsel representing minor: An attorney must obtain court approval prior to withdrawing as attorney of record for a minor appearing through a guardian ad litem. [Torres v. Friedman (1985) 169 CA3d 880, 887, 215 CR 604, 608]The court has a duty to see that the minor’s interests are not prejudiced by those appointed to represent the minor, and may refuse to relieve the attorney until other qualified counsel has been obtained. If, due to extenuating circumstances, the court allows the attorney to withdraw, it must apprise the guardian of the need to obtain qualified replacement counsel and that the guardian may not proceed in propria persona. [Torres v. Friedman, supra, 169 CA3d at 888, 215 CR at 609]2) [9:385.4] Where dispositive motion pending: It may be error for the court to permit counsel for a minor to withdraw when a dispositive motion (e.g., motion for summary judgment) is pending and a new attorney has not yet been retained. [Mossanen v. Monfared (2000) 77 CA4th 1402, 1409-1410, 92 CR2d 459, 463-464][9:385.5 - 9:385.9] Reserved.(b) [9:385.10] Judicial Council forms: Forms adopted by the Judicial Council must be used for the notice of motion and motion to be relieved as counsel, supporting declaration and order. [CRC 3.1362(a); see ¶ 9:386, 9:387 & 9:392]Compare—limited scope representation: Different forms must be used where the attorney was retained for only a limited scope representation. [CRC 3.36; see ¶ 1:192 ff.]➪ [9:385.11] PRACTICE POINTER: Failure to use these forms is a common error in seeking to be relieved as counsel. Judges should never grant the motion if it is not on the Judicial Council forms.The second most common error is failure to check all the applicable boxes and to provide all the information required by the forms. If these forms are completed properly, no other papers are ordinarily required.1) [9:386] Notice of motion: The notice of motion must be directed to the client and must be on the Judicial Council form. [CRC 3.1362(a)]• FORM: Notice of Motion and Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (mandatory Judicial Council form MC-051), see Form 9A:21 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).2) [9:387] Supporting declaration: The notice must be accompanied by counsel’s declaration showing why a substitution of attorneys by consent could not be obtained. Such declaration must be stated “in general terms and without compromising the confidentiality of the attorney-client relationship.” [CRC 3.1362(c)]• FORM: Declaration in Support of Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (mandatory Judicial Council form MC-052), see Form 9A:22 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[9:387.1 - 9:387.4] Reserved.3) [9:387.5] No memorandum of points and authorities: Unlike other motions, no memorandum of points and authorities need be filed or served with a motion to be relieved as counsel. [CRC 3.1362(b)](c) [9:388] Service: The notice of motion, declaration and proposed order must be served on the client and all other parties who have appeared in the case. [CRC 3.1362(d)]1) [9:389] Special requirements where client served by mail: When the client is served by mail, the attorney’s declaration must show that the client’s address was confirmed within the last 30 days and how it was confirmed (i.e., by conversation, telephone, or mail with return receipt requested). [CRC 3.1362(d)]Merely stating the papers were sent to the client’s last known address and were not returned will not itself be sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current. [CRC 3.1362(d)][9:390] Reserved.2) [9:391] Where client’s address unknown: If the attorney is unable to confirm that the client’s address is current, the attorney’s declaration must state what was done in attempting to obtain a current address, such as:— mailing the motion papers to the client’s last known address with return receipt requested;— calling the client’s last known telephone number(s);— contacting persons familiar with the client (specify);— conducting a search (describe); and— other efforts, which must be specified. [CRC 3.1362(d)]Counsel must also justify why counsel should be relieved even if the client cannot be served with the moving papers.If the attorney’s declaration establishes that the client’s residence address is unknown despite reasonable efforts to locate the client, the client can be served by delivering the moving papers to the court clerk. [CCP § 1011(b)(3); CRC 3.1362(d) (last sent.)]The papers must be placed in an envelope addressed to the clerk and prepared in accordance with CRC 3.252.3) [9:391.1] Special requirements where client served by electronic service: When the client is served by electronic service, the attorney’s declaration must show that the client’s electronic address was confirmed within 30 days. [CRC 3.1362(d)(2)]“Merely demonstrating that the notice was sent to the client’s last known address and was not returned or no electronic delivery failure message was received is not, by itself, sufficient to demonstrate that the address is current.” [CRC 3.1362(d)(2)](d) [9:392] Order: A copy of the proposed order must be lodged with the court clerk and served on the client with the moving papers. [CRC 3.1362(e)]The order must be prepared on the Judicial Council form.It must specify all hearing dates scheduled in the action or proceeding, including the trial date, if known. If no hearing date is presently scheduled, the court may set one and specify the date in the order. [CRC 3.1362(d), (e)]FORM: Order Granting Attorney’s Motion to be Relieved as Counsel—Civil (mandatory Judicial Council form MC-053), see Form 9A:23 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).1) [9:392.1] Warnings to client: The Official Form Order provides warnings to the client of adverse results that may occur if the client fails to obtain representation.(e) [9:393] Service of order: A copy of the signed order must be served on the client and on all parties who have appeared in the action. [CRC 3.1362(e)]The court may delay the effective date of the order until proof of service of a copy of the signed order on the client has been filed with the court. [CRC 3.1362(e); Gamet v. Blanchard (2001) 91 CA4th 1276, 1286, 111 CR2d 439, 446—lack of proper service rendered order inoperative][9:394 - 9:400] Reserved. 4. [9:401] Out-Of-State Attorneys; Admission Pro Hac Vice: An out-of-state lawyer, not admitted to practice in California, may be admitted pro hac vice—i.e., to appear and take part in a particular action only. Applications for such admission are generally heard as law and motion matters. [CRC 9.40]The rule applies to individual lawyers, not law firms. Out-of-state law firms cannot be admitted pro hac vice. It is sufficient that the firm member handling the case is either a California lawyer or has been admitted pro hac vice. [Daybreak Group, Inc. v. Three Creeks Ranch, LLC (2008) 162 CA4th 37, 42, 75 CR3d 365, 367—firm member of Montana law firm was admitted to practice in California]If permission is granted, the out-of-state attorney is admitted to practice on the same terms as a local attorney, and is subject to the same professional standards and sanctions and to the jurisdiction of California courts. [See CRC 9.40(f)]The unauthorized practice of law in California is a misdemeanor (Bus. & Prof.C. § 6126). Out-of-state lawyers not admitted pro hac vice will not be awarded fees for their work. [Golba v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (2015) 238 CA4th 1251, 1261, 1265, 190 CR3d 337, 344, 347]a. [9:402] Requirements: To be eligible for admission pro hac vice:• The applicant must be admitted to practice before a U.S. court, or the highest court of any state or territory; and• The applicant must not be a California resident, nor regularly engaged in “substantial business, professional, or other activities” here; and• An active licensee of the California Bar must be associated as attorney of record in the case. [CRC 9.40(a)]Absent special circumstances, repeated appearances by out-of-state counsel in California lawsuits is cause for denial of the application. [CRC 9.40(b); Walter E. Heller Western, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (1980) 111 CA3d 706, 709, 168 CR 785, 786; see Golba v. Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (2015) 238 CA4th 1251, 1266, 190 CR3d 337, 348—application denied where attorney had appeared 12 times in California state courts within prior 11 months]b. [9:403] Application: The applicant must file a verified application (often a declaration) stating: (1) the applicant’s residence and office addresses; (2) the court or courts in which the applicant is admitted to practice and the dates of admission; (3) that the applicant is in good standing in such courts; (4) that the applicant is not currently suspended or disbarred in any court; (5) the title and case number of any action in this state (presumably whether state or federal) in which the applicant has applied to appear pro hac vice during the preceding two years; and (6) the name, address and telephone number of the active licensee of the State Bar who is attorney of record. [CRC 9.40(d), (e)—filing fee must accompany application]FORM: Application for Admission Pro Hac Vice, see Form 9A:24 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).➪ [9:403.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Because the notion of “regularly” practicing law within the meaning of CRC 9.40(a) is not fully defined, applicants should state in their applications the number of times they have been admitted pro hac vice in the last two years in California state and federal courts and be prepared to respond to inquiries from the court on how much time in those last two years has been spent on California cases.Many judges handle these applications without a hearing. But in the event of an issue, those judges will either issue an order requiring further information or set a hearing.c. [9:404] Service: Copies of the application must be served by mail upon all parties who have appeared in the action, and also upon the State Bar at its San Francisco office at least 16 court days before the hearing (notice governed by CCP § 1005). A fee (currently $50) must be paid to the State Bar. [CRC 9.40(c)(1), (e) (applications to superior court)][9:405] Reserved.d. [9:406] Distinguish—registered foreign legal consultants: Lawyers licensed in foreign countries may register as foreign legal consultants in California. (Application is made to the State Bar.) [CRC 9.44]Such registration permits the foreign lawyer to consult and advise regarding laws of the country in which the lawyer is licensed. It does not, however, entitle the foreign lawyer to represent anyone in any court or before any magistrate or other judicial officer; nor to prepare court papers or other documents affecting personal or property rights or status in the U.S.; nor to render legal advice on the law of the State of California, any other state, the District of Columbia, the United States or any jurisdiction other than the one for which the lawyer is registered. [See CRC 9.44(d)]e. [9:406a] Distinguish—international arbitration: Non-California lawyers may represent parties in California in international arbitration. [CCP §§ 1297.185, 1297.186]f. [9:406.1] Sanctioning pro hac vice counsel: The court has inherent power to revoke an out-of-state attorney’s pro hac vice status for conduct that would be ground for disqualification of a California lawyer (e.g., fraud on court). The court’s power to impose sanctions, however, is limited to those authorized by statute against California lawyers. [Sheller v. Sup.Ct. (Farmers New World Life Ins. Co.) (2008) 158 CA4th 1697, 1716, 71 CR3d 207, 220—no inherent power to order payment of opposing party’s fees or to impose reprimand][9:406.2 - 9:406.4] Reserved. 5. [9:406.5] Motion to Recuse (Disqualify) Opposing Counsel: A party may move to recuse (disqualify) counsel for the opposing party on grounds recognized by law, including mandatory disqualification for conflict of interest based on a prior (successive) or current representation. [See Lynn v. George (2017) 15 CA5th 630, 637, 223 CR3d 407, 413; and ¶ 1:39 ff. for discussion of grounds for disqualification]The minority view holds that a person with a confidential or fiduciary relationship with the attorney also may move to disqualify the attorney. [Moreci v. Scaffold Solutions, Inc. (2021) 70 CA5th 425, 432-433, 285 CR3d 315, 322-323 & fn. 2 (collecting cases); see Lynn v. George, supra, 15 CA5th at 638, 223 CR3d at 413-414—possible to disqualify counsel who had “confidential nonclient relationship”]A motion to disqualify may also be brought for a violation of the “advocate-witness rule” (discussed at ¶ 1:102). However, disqualifying a testifying lawyer despite client consent “must be based on a convincing showing of prejudice to the opposing party or the potential for palpable injury to the judicial process.” [Geringer v. Blue Rider Finance (2023) 94 CA5th 813, 822-823, 312 CR3d 618, 626; see CRPC 3.7]a. [9:406.6] Court’s power: A court has inherent power “[t]o control in furtherance of justice, the conduct of its ministerial officers, and of all other persons in any manner connected with a judicial proceeding before it, in every manner pertaining thereto.” [CCP § 128(a)(5)]This includes the power to disqualify counsel in appropriate cases. [In re Complex Asbestos Litig. (1991) 232 CA3d 572, 575, 283 CR 732, 739]b. [9:406.7] Procedure: A recusal motion is made in the same manner as other motions and subject to the requirements discussed in this Chapter (¶ 9:19 ff.). See also ¶ 1:90 ff.c. [9:406.8] Factors considered: Ruling on the motion requires the court to weigh:— the party’s right to counsel of choice;— the attorney’s interest in representing a client;— the financial burden on a client of changing counsel;— any tactical abuse underlying a disqualification motion; and— the principle that the fair resolution of disputes requires vigorous representation of parties by independent counsel. [Mills Land & Water Co. v. Golden West Refining Co. (1986) 186 CA3d 116, 126, 230 CR 461, 465 (superseded by rule on other grounds)](1) [9:406.8a] Proof required in successive representation cases: In successive representation cases, where a lawyer’s duty of confidentiality is the focus, if the moving party establishes that a “substantial relationship” exists between the former representation and current litigation, a presumption arises that the attorney has obtained confidential information from the former client (see ¶ 1:66 ff.). [Fiduciary Trust Int’l of Calif. v. Sup.Ct. (Brown) (2013) 218 CA4th 465, 481, 160 CR3d 216, 227-228; National Grange of Order of Patrons of Husbandry v. California Guild (2019) 38 CA5th 706, 716, 250 CR3d 705, 715—if attorney previously worked on case substantially related to current case, or on same case, “it is conclusively presumed that attorney knows confidential information adverse to his or her former client” (emphasis added)]Absent such a showing, the moving party must prove the lawyer in fact obtained such information—i.e., “some showing of the nature of the communications or a statement of how they relate to the current representation.” [Elliott v. McFarland Unified School Dist. (1985) 165 CA3d 562, 570-572, 211 CR 802, 808—conclusory statements (“I have confided in attorney”) insufficient to establish lawyer’s receipt of confidential information; Med-Trans Corp., Inc. v. City of Calif. City (2007) 156 CA4th 655, 668, 68 CR3d 17, 27; Khani v. Ford Motor Co. (2013) 215 CA4th 916, 922, 155 CR3d 532, 536—bare-bones statement that lawyer represented former client in cases brought under same statute not sufficient to raise presumption that lawyer obtained confidential information material to new case](2) [9:406.8b] Proof required in concurrent representation cases: The primary attorney duty at stake is that of loyalty, and generally disqualification in concurrent representation cases is “automatic.” [Flatt v. Sup.Ct. (Daniel) (1994) 9 C4th 275, 284, 36 CR2d 537, 542; M’Guinness v. Johnson (2015) 243 CA4th 602, 614, 196 CR3d 662, 671]Cross-refer: Recusal motions are discussed further in Tuft & Mohr, Cal. Prac. Guide: Professional Responsibility & Liability (TRG), Ch. 4.d. [9:406.9] Effect of delayed motion: Disqualification motions are equitable in nature and therefore subject to equitable defenses. Last-minute recusal motions that appear to be “trial tactics” may be denied on the ground of laches. [River West, Inc. v. Nickel (1987) 188 CA3d 1297, 1304, 234 CR 33, 38; Liberty Nat’l Enterprises, L.P. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. (2011) 194 CA4th 839, 847, 123 CR3d 498, 504—proper for trial court to deny motion brought “as a tactical device to delay the litigation”; see also City & County of San Francisco v. Cobra Solutions, Inc. (2014) 232 CA4th 468, 474-475, 181 CR3d 430, 435-436 (motion to restrict access to disqualified counsel’s work product)—delay in moving to restrict access unreasonable, and prejudice from delay extreme, resulting in waiver of right to restrict access to disqualified counsel’s work product]When the party opposing the motion shows unreasonable delay causing prejudice, the burden shifts to the moving party to justify the delay. [Liberty Nat’l Enterprises, L.P. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra, 194 CA4th at 845, 123 CR3d at 502; Fiduciary Trust Int’l of Calif. v. Sup.Ct. (Brown), supra, 218 CA4th at 490, 160 CR3d at 235 (finding rule inapplicable based on opposing party’s failure to demonstrate extreme prejudice resulting from delay)](1) [9:406.10] Motion by former client: Where the motion is made by a former client to disqualify counsel from representing the present client, the following factors are usually considered in determining whether the former client is guilty of laches:— how long the former client has known of the potential conflict of interest;— whether the former client has been represented by counsel since such discovery;— whether the former client was prevented from making the motion earlier (and if so, how); and— whether an earlier motion would have been inappropriate or futile and why. [River West, Inc. v. Nickel, supra, 188 CA3d at 1309, 234 CR at 41][9:406.11 - 9:406.14] Reserved.e. [9:406.15] Ruling immediately appealable: Since a recusal motion is in effect a request for injunctive relief (to restrain opposing counsel from participating in the case), the court’s order granting or denying the motion is immediately appealable. [See CCP § 904.1(a)(6); Machado v. Sup.Ct. (Atherton) (2007) 148 CA4th 875, 882, 55 CR3d 902, 906-907; Gregori v. Bank of America (1989) 207 CA3d 291, 300, 254 CR 853, 858]Note: Such an appeal does not automatically stay the action. If such a stay is desired, the appellant may ask the trial court to stay the proceeding until the appeal is decided; if the trial court denies the request, the appellant may seek a stay from the appellate court. [Reed v. Sup.Ct. (Case Fin’l, Inc.) (2001) 92 CA4th 448, 452-455, 111 CR2d 842, 845-847]However, an appeal does automatically stay enforcement of an order of attorney disqualification. [URS Corp. v.

(It is discussed in detail in Knight, Chernick, Quinn & Gupta, Cal. Prac. Guide: Alternative Dispute Resolution (TRG), Ch. 5.) The discussion here outlines the typical issues handled in court; e.g., motions or petitions to compel arbitration (see ¶ 9:407.3 ff.), motions to confirm or vacate arbitration awards (see ¶ 9:412 ff.), some of the most common defenses (see ¶ 9:407.9 ff.), and special issues pertaining to possible preemption of state law relating to arbitration (see ¶ 9:408.39 ff.). 1. [9:407.1] Who Decides Threshold Issues: The trial court typically decides the threshold (or “gatekeeper”) issues of enforceability of the arbitration agreement and the scope of issues to be arbitrated. [Aanderud v. Sup.Ct. (Vivint Solar Developer, LLC) (2017) 13 CA5th 880, 891, 221 CR3d 225, 234—courts presume parties intend courts rather than arbitrators to decide disputes about arbitrability; see Theresa D. v. MBK Senior Living LLC (2021) 73 CA5th 18, 25-27, 288 CR3d 87, 91-93—courts decide if there is an arbitration agreement, and whether signatory is authorized to sign for party; see also Banc of Calif., Nat’l Ass’n v. Sup.Ct. (N977CB Holdings, LLC) (2021) 69 CA5th 357, 369, 284 CR3d 484, 493—where issue is whether an agreement to arbitrate found in different agreement controls, court must decide parties’ intent to have second agreement apply]However, the parties may delegate resolution of these issues to the arbitrator as long as there is clear and unmistakable evidence they intended to do so and the delegation clause is not revocable on state law grounds such as fraud, duress or unconscionability. [Pinela v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. (2015) 238 CA4th 227, 239-240, 190 CR3d 159, 169-170; Tiri v. Lucky Chances, Inc. (2014) 226 CA4th 231, 250, 171 CR3d 621, 636—trial court precluded from deciding enforceability of arbitration agreement where explicit provision delegating issue to arbitrator was clear, unmistakable and not unconscionable; Zhang v. Sup.Ct. (Dentons US LLP) (2022) 85 CA5th 167, 174-175, 180-182, 301 CR3d 164, 168-169, 172-174, rev.grntd. 2/15/23 (Case No. S277736) (cited pursuant to CRC 8.1115(e))—agreement clear and unmistakable because it “clearly states that ‘all disputes relating to the validity, breach, interpretation or enforcement’ are to be resolved by the arbitrator”]Despite broad delegation clauses, other cases have found them ineffective in delegating arbitrability to the arbitrator. [See Beco v. Fast Auto Loans, Inc. (2022) 86 CA5th 292, 303, 302 CR3d 168, 176—ambiguous language concerning arbitrability of “‘any such controversy or claim’ could very easily be read to mean a specific substantive dispute or claim, not the issue of who decides whether the entire agreement is enforceable or unconscionable”; Wilson-Davis v. SSP America, Inc. (2021) 62 CA5th 1080, 1091, 277 CR3d 258, 265-266—no delegation of arbitrability in collective bargaining agreement that only permitted grievances to be arbitrated and limited arbitrator’s powers to those issues parties specifically agreed in writing to arbitrate; Dennison v. Rosland Capital LLC (2020) 47 CA5th 204, 209-210, 260 CR3d 675, 679-680—no delegation to arbitrator to decide if arbitration agreement was enforceable where severability clause provided court may excise unconscionable provision; Ajamian v. CantorCO2e, L.P. (2012) 203 CA4th 771, 787-788, 137 CR3d 773, 787—clause did not clearly state that arbitrator would decide enforceability of arbitration clause itself; Gostev v. Skillz Platform, Inc. (2023) 88 CA5th 1035, 1051-1052, 305 CR3d 248, 258-260—broad language in third-party provider rules incorporated by reference in arbitration agreement does not meet heightened standard for delegation to arbitrator]And previous cases have held that when the arbitration agreement clearly and unmistakably delegated the arbitrability issue to the arbitrators, “then the court should perform a second, more limited inquiry to determine whether the assertion of arbitrability is wholly groundless” (Smythe v. Uber Technologies, Inc. (2018) 24 CA5th 327, 332, 233 CR3d 895, 898 (internal quotes omitted)). However, at least to the extent the agreement is subject to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), the “wholly groundless” exception is inconsistent with the text of the FAA, so the arbitrator should decide the arbitrability issue. [Henry Schein, Inc. v. Archer & White Sales, Inc. (2019) 586 US 63, 68, 139 S.Ct. 524, 529]a. [9:407.1a] Compare—who decides challenges to delegation clause: Where there is a specific challenge to the enforceability of the delegation clause, the court must decide that issue. [Nielsen Contracting, Inc. v. Applied Underwriters, Inc.

If the signatory to a written arbitration clause must rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting its claims against the nonsignatory, the nonsignatory may enforce that arbitration agreement against the signatory. Also, when the claims against the nonsignatory are “founded in and inextricably bound up with” the obligations imposed by the agreement containing the arbitration clause, the nonsignatory may enforce the arbitration agreement.

[Ramirez v. Charter Communications, Inc. (2024) 16 C5th 478, 517, 322 CR3d 825, 858]While “there are no bright line numerical rules regarding severance, it is fair to say that the greater the number of unconscionable provisions a contract contains the less likely it is that severance will be the appropriate remedy.” And if the unconscionability cannot be cured by severing the unconscionable provisions, but instead would require rewriting the contract and imposing terms to which the parties did not agree, the court should refuse to enforce the contract. [Ramirez v. Charter Communications, Inc., supra, 16 C5th at 516-517, 322 CR3d at 857]The “interests of justice” factor considers whether severance would in effect condone an illegal scheme, and whether the unconscionable parts of the agreement show a systematic effort to impose arbitration on the weaker party in an effort to obtain a forum that works to the stronger party’s advantage.

[9:408] Determining enforceability of arbitration agreement: Typically, the facts regarding the existence or enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate “are to be proven by affidavit or declaration and documentary evidence with oral testimony taken only in the court’s discretion … With respect to claims of fraud, where factual differences may be difficult to resolve without making credibility determinations, oral testimony is generally appropriate.” [Sonic-Calabasas A, Inc. v. Moreno, supra, 57 C4th at 1157, 163 CR3d at 301 (internal quotes and citations omitted)]Where the facts are in dispute or credibility issues are involved (such as when fraud is alleged), “the better course would normally be for the trial court to hear oral testimony and allow the parties the opportunity for cross-examination.” [Rosenthal v.

If any party is unable to pay its share, the moving party can elect either to pay that portion of the arbitration cost or to waive its right to arbitrate that party’s claim. [Roldan v. Callahan & Blaine (2013) 219 CA4th 87, 96, 161 CR3d 493, 499]When a party arbitrates in good faith but the cost of the arbitration becomes too much for the party, it may petition the court for relief. If the court “concludes the party’s financial status is not a result of the party’s intentional attempt to avoid arbitration, the court may issue an order specifying: (1) the arbitration shall continue so long as the other party to the arbitration agrees to pay, or the arbitrator orders it to pay, all fees and costs of the arbitration; and (2) if neither of those occur, the arbitration shall be deemed ‘had’ and the case may proceed in the superior court.” [Weiler v.

[9:408.3] Effect of plaintiff dismissing complaint: There is nothing to preclude plaintiff from voluntarily dismissing a complaint after the case has been ordered to arbitration but before the arbitration has commenced.

[9:408.15] Waiver of contractual right to arbitrate: Under the generally applicable law of waiver, to establish waiver of the right to arbitrate, the party opposing enforcement of an arbitration agreement must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the waiving party knew of the contractual right to arbitrate and intentionally relinquished or abandoned it. That can be proved either by evidence of words expressing an intent to relinquish it or of conduct that is so inconsistent with an intent to enforce as to lead a reasonable factfinder to conclude the party had abandoned it. Only the waiving party’s words or conduct are relevant. The party opposing enforcement of the contractual right need not show prejudice or harm resulting from the waiving party’s conduct. [Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc.

[Saint Agnes Med. Ctr. v. PacifiCare of Calif. (2003) 31 C4th 1187, 1201, 8 CR3d 517, 528 (overruled on other grounds by Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc. (2024) 16 C5th 562, 583, 323 CR3d 126, 142)]Thus, for example, evidence that a party knew of its right to arbitrate but chose to actively participate in litigation, including requesting a jury, posting jury fees, engaging in discovery, and waiting for 13 months before seeking arbitration, is inconsistent with an intent to arbitrate and can support a finding that the party waived its right to arbitrate the dispute. [Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc. (2024) 16 C5th 562, 585-587, 323 CR3d 126, 144-145](a) [9:408.17] Caution re former case law: Cases decided prior to Quach (¶ 9:408.16) commonly applied what was known as the “St. Agnes factors” to determine whether the right to compel arbitration was lost as a result of participating in litigation. Quach made it clear that whether the delay in moving to arbitrate affected, misled, or prejudiced the opposing party is no longer a relevant factor to consider. But Quach also warned that some of the St. Agnes factors are relevant to defenses other than waiver, such as forfeiture, estoppel, laches or timeliness, and that courts “should not apply the St. Agnes factors as a single multifactor test for determining whether the right to compel arbitration has been lost through litigation.” [Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc.

But defendant actively conducted discovery, checked a box requesting a jury on its Case Management Conference Statement, did not check the box requesting arbitration, stated it intended to file a dispositive motion, and posted jury fees. Thirteen months after the lawsuit was filed, defendant claimed it had just located a complete copy of plaintiff’s arbitration agreement and moved to compel arbitration. This was clear and convincing evidence defendant was aware of its right to compel arbitration and intentionally abandoned that right. [Quach v. California Commerce Club, Inc.

Months later, it sought an order compelling arbitration. The record contained clear and convincing evidence that defendant chose not to exercise its right to compel arbitration and to defend itself in court, thus waiving its right to arbitrate.

The EFAA applies where the parties’ transaction “sufficiently involve[s] interstate commerce,” and, where there is a nexus to interstate commerce, conflicting state law is preempted. [Casey v. Sup.Ct. of Contra Costa County (D.R. Horton, Inc.) (2025) 108 CA5th 575, 580-586, 329 CR3d 518, 522-526—“the EFAA preempts attempts under state law to compel arbitration of cases relating to a sexual harassment dispute, and parties cannot contract around the law by way of a choice-of-law provision”](3) [9:408.43] Preemption under Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA): State claims that require the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) are generally preempted by section 301 of the LMRA (29 USC § 185(a)) and are arbitrable under the terms of the CBA. There is no preemption where “[t]he collective bargaining agreement must be consulted or referenced, but not interpreted.” [Melendez v. San Francisco Baseball Assocs.

[Iskanian v. CLS Transp. Los Angeles, LLC (2014) 59 C4th 348, 386-387, 173 CR3d 289, 315]For cases subject to the FAA, however, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the FAA preempts the rule stated in Iskanian, supra, insofar as that rule precludes division of PAGA actions into “individual” claims (i.e., those individual Labor Code claims for which the PAGA plaintiff seeks penalties on the plaintiff’s own behalf) and “non-individual” claims (i.e., those brought in a representative capacity for violations suffered by other aggrieved employees) through an agreement to arbitrate. [Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana (2022) 596 US 639, 662, 142 S.Ct. 1906, 1924-1925—former employer was entitled to compel arbitration of former employee’s individual PAGA claim]The Court also stated that the FAA does not preempt Iskanian’s holding that a prelitigation wholesale waiver of PAGA claims is unenforceable. Therefore, the Court found the representative claims were not subject to the arbitration clause, and, because the individual plaintiff’s claims had been sent to arbitration, there was no party with standing to assert the representative claims. Thus, the Court concluded the representative claims should be dismissed (Viking River Cruises, Inc. v. Moriana, supra, 596 US at 662-663, 142 S.Ct. at 1924-1925). However, the California Supreme Court held, subsequent to Viking River Cruises, that the individual does not lose standing and the representative PAGA claims may be stayed pending arbitration.

The California Supreme Court has granted review on whether the FAA preempts state statutes prescribing the procedures for paying arbitration fees and providing for forfeiture of the right to arbitrate if timely payment is not made by the party who drafted the arbitration agreement and who is required to pay such fees (Hohenshelt v. Sup.Ct. (Golden State Foods Corp.) (2024) 99 CA5th 1319, 318 CR3d 475, rev. grntd. 6/12/24 (Case No. S284498); Hernandez v. Sohnen Enterprises, Inc.

[9:408.45] Consumer arbitration agreements with banks: CCP § 1281.2(d) bars enforcement of a written arbitration agreement between consumers and a state- or federally-chartered depository institution if the agreement was created by the institution’s fraud without the consumer’s consent and by unlawfully using the consumer’s personal identifying information.c. [9:408.46] Employment agreements: For contracts entered into after January 1, 2020, employers are prohibited from requiring (such as in an arbitration agreement) as a “condition of employment” an applicant or employee to “waive any right, forum, or procedure” for alleged violations of the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA, Gov.C. § 12900 et seq.) or the Labor Code. [Lab.C. § 432.6(a)] “[A]n agreement that requires an employee to opt out of a waiver or take any affirmative action in order to preserve their rights is deemed a condition of employment.” [Lab.C. § 432.6(c)]These provisions do not invalidate a written arbitration agreement otherwise enforceable under the FAA, post-dispute settlement agreements, or negotiated severance agreements (Lab.C. § 432.6(f), (g)). However, Lab.C. § 432.6 has been held void as preempted by the FAA because it “discriminates against arbitration by discouraging or prohibiting the formation of an arbitration agreement.” [Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v. Bonta (9th Cir. 2023) 62 F4th 473, 486]As a matter of federal law, at the election of the claimant no “predispute arbitration agreement” or “predispute joint-action waiver” shall be valid or enforceable in cases alleging sexual assault or sexual harassment. The parties may agree to arbitration after the dispute occurs. Disputes regarding whether these provisions are applicable or enforceable to an arbitration agreement must be resolved under federal law by a court, not an arbitrator, for any dispute or claim that “arises or accrues on or after” March 3, 2022 (Pub.L. 117-90).

[9:408.47] Dealing with consumer or employment “arbitration limbo”: The postponement of an arbitration as result of a party (usually the drafter of the arbitration clause) failing to pay the arbitration fee and costs is prohibited. If the costs are not paid within 30 days of the due date, the drafting party is in breach of the arbitration agreement, waives arbitration, and the consumer or employee may either withdraw the arbitration claim and proceed in court, or compel arbitration and have the defaulting party pay attorney fees and costs related to the arbitration.

Otherwise, some judges routinely dismiss proceedings in order to “chalk up” one more disposition. Dismissal creates problems if you thereafter need court orders to replace the arbitrator, enforce discovery, etc.But note: generally, “once a dispute has been sent to arbitration, the courts may not act on that dispute absent an agreement to withdraw” the case from arbitration. [Bucur v. Ahmad (2016) 244 CA4th 175, 188, 198 CR3d 127, 137]For example, once a case has been ordered to arbitration, a court cannot impose CCP § 128.7 “sanctions for an attorney’s prosecution of a client’s meritless claim before the arbitrator.” [Optimal Markets, Inc. v. Salant (2013) 221 CA4th 912, 922, 164 CR3d 901, 908]Cross-refer: For a detailed discussion of these procedures, along with applicable forms, see Knight, Chernick, Quinn & Gupta, Cal. Prac.

[9:419] Compare—Motion to Unseal Records6. [9:420] Compare—Procedure to Use Documents Subject to Confidentiality Agreement or Protective Order[9:416] Unless confidentiality is required by law, court records are presumed to be open to the public (CRC 2.550(c)). Therefore, pleadings, motions, evidence (including that obtained in discovery), and other papers may not be filed under seal merely by stipulation of the parties. A prior court order must be obtained. [CRC 2.551(a); see H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 CA4th 879, 888, 60 CR3d 501, 507]The judge who ordered the sealing (or a judge to whom the case is subsequently assigned) may order sealed documents unsealed. [Marriage of Nicholas (2010) 186 CA4th 1566, 1577, 113 CR3d 629, 637]Anyone (including the judge on the judge’s own motion) at any time may apply to have the records unsealed. [CRC 2.551(h)(2); see ¶ 9:419]Compare—discovery motions: The criteria and procedures for sealing records (CRC 2.550 et seq.) do not apply to discovery motions. See ¶ 9:418.25 ff. ➪ [9:416.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Many, if not most, motions to seal are unnecessary because the judge does not need to review the confidential material in order to decide the underlying motion. In such cases, simply file the redacted document in the public file and explain the redaction in, e.g., the accompanying memorandum of points and authorities.Local rules vary regarding how to lodge documents subject to a motion to seal, particularly if the documents or motion are filed electronically (see ¶ 9:92.2a). Be sure to check the local rules applicable to your motion. 1. [9:417] Moving Papers: A written motion or application is required, accompanied by points and authorities and by declarations stating facts supporting the findings required for a sealing order (¶ 9:418). [CRC 2.551(b); see H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe, supra, 151 CA4th at 894, 60 CR3d at 512—moving party must present “specific enumeration of the facts sought to be withheld and specific reasons for withholding them”]Admissible evidence is required to support a sealing motion; generally, declarations of counsel relating to trade secrets or other overriding interest to justify sealing are inadmissible hearsay. The evidence must support the sealing of all materials or facts in issue.FORM: Motion to File Records Under Seal and Proposed Order, see Form 9A:25 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).a. [9:417.1] Parties’ agreement not enough: Parties sometimes operate under an informal arrangement pursuant to which documents are “deemed filed under seal” unless an objection is made. Such an arrangement “is entirely inconsistent with the mandatory requirements of rules 2.550 and 2.551 and the constitutional values informing those requirements.” [Savaglio v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 CA4th 588, 600, 57 CR3d 215, 223, fn. 8; McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n (2015) 234 CA4th 25, 29, 35-36, 183 CR3d 490, 492, 497-498—prelawsuit confidentiality agreement insufficient to support sealing order]b. [9:417.2] Actions pending before temporary judge or referee: A motion to seal records in actions pending before a temporary judge or referee must be heard by the trial judge to whom the case is assigned; or, if no trial judge has been assigned, by the presiding judge or the presiding judge’s designee. [CRC 2.835, 3.932]c. [9:417.3] Lodging documents: The documents at issue must be lodged with the clerk, in a separate envelope sealed and labeled “CONDITIONALLY UNDER SEAL” if lodged in paper form. If transmitted electronically, a cover sheet must be affixed to the electronic transmission indicating they are subject to a motion to file the documents under seal. If the motion or application is denied, the moving party may notify the court within 10 days after denial that the documents may be filed unsealed. If such a notification is not received within 10 days of the order denying the motion, the clerk must return the lodged documents to the moving party if they are in paper form, or permanently delete the lodged documents if in electronic form. If the motion or application is granted, the sealed documents remain sealed until further order of the court. [See CRC 2.551(b)(6), (d), (e)]➪ [9:417.4] PRACTICE POINTER: Some judges appreciate the lodging of a document that shows the proposed redactions to the publicly filed document in context, such as by red-lining. Also, consider filing the motion to seal before the underlying motion; if the sealing request is denied and the materials are withdrawn as a result, the record for the underlying motion may differ.d. [9:417.5] Filing before order obtained waives confidentiality: If the party seeking the sealing order files the documents with the court before the motion to seal is granted, the right to move for an order sealing the documents is waived. The court cannot entertain a later motion to seal documents that are already a matter of public record. [Savaglio v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (2007) 149 CA4th 588, 601, 57 CR3d 215, 224; but see In re M.T. (2024) 106 CA5th 322, 328, 343-344, 326 CR3d 808, 812-813, 824-825 (granting motion to seal entire record of transgender plaintiff’s petition for change of name and gender five years after original proceedings where plaintiff’s safety and privacy outweighed public’s right of access); ¶ 9:418.9]e. [9:417.6] Sanctions for overbroad sealing request: Sanctions may be imposed for overbroad requests to seal. [Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 471, 500, 180 CR3d 234, 259—trial court should view “overly inclusive sealing efforts with a jaundiced eye, and impose sanctions as appropriate”][9:417.7 - 9:417.9] Reserved.(1) [9:417.10] Compare—material subject to confidentiality agreement or protective order: Distinct rules apply where a party seeks to use another party’s materials already covered by a confidentiality agreement or protective order at trial or for other adjudication purposes without requesting a sealing order. See discussion at ¶ 9:420. 2. [9:418] Findings Required: To grant such an order, the court must expressly find that:— an overriding interest exists that overcomes the right of public access to the record;— the overriding interest supports sealing the records;— a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the record is not sealed;— the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and— no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest. [CRC 2.550(d); see McGuan v. Endovascular Technologies, Inc. (2010) 182 CA4th 974, 988, 106 CR3d 277, 290]These findings embody constitutional requirements for a request to seal court records, protecting the First Amendment right of public access to civil trials. [See NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Locke) (1999) 20 C4th 1178, 1217-1218, 86 CR2d 778, 809; Huffy Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.) (2003) 112 CA4th 97, 104, 4 CR3d 823, 830 (abrogation on other grounds recognized by Curtis v. Sup.Ct. (California Employment Lawyers Ass’n) (2021) 62 CA5th 453, 471, 276 CR3d 676, 690); People v. Jackson (2005) 128 CA4th 1009, 1026-1027, 27 CR3d 596, 608—in determining whether to seal records, courts must weigh constitutional requirements for disclosure against such factors as privacy rights]If the trial court fails to make the required findings, the order is deficient and cannot support sealing. [Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 471, 487, 180 CR3d 234, 249]a. [9:418a] Compare—sealed records on appeal: Similar findings are required in connection with motions to seal records on appeal. [CRC 8.46(d)(6)—court may order sealing only if it makes findings required by CRC 2.550(d)-(e); see McNair v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n (2015) 234 CA4th 25, 29, 183 CR3d 490, 492—party’s interest in confidentiality of proceedings (based on its bylaws and contracts) insufficient to override constitutional right of access and justify sealing of appellate record]Cross-refer: For detailed discussion of sealed records on appeal, see Eisenberg, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Appeals & Writs (TRG), Ch. 5. 3. [9:418.1] Sealing Order: A sealing order must (a) specifically state facts supporting the above findings (¶ 9:418) and (b) be narrowly tailored—i.e., the order should direct sealing of only those portions of documents that need to be under seal; all other portions of each document must remain in the public file. [CRC 2.550(e)(1); Glassdoor, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Machine Zone, Inc.) (2017) 9 CA5th 623, 638, 215 CR3d 395, 408—trial court’s “boilerplate findings” that sealing order was “narrowly tailored” are insufficient; but see In re M.T. (2024) 106 CA5th 322, 345-346, 326 CR3d 808, 827-828—where there was no way to seal only part of record and still protect transgender plaintiff’s name and privacy from harassers, circumstances presented “the presumably rare case” in which narrowly tailoring a sealing order mandated sealing the entire record of name change and gender marker correction; and ¶ 9:418.9]a. [9:418.2] Alternative order to strike: Where the material that is the subject of the sealing motion is irrelevant, the court should simply strike it. [Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 471, 510, 180 CR3d 234, 267]➪ [9:418.3] PRACTICE POINTER: Because the court must make the required findings prior to a sealing order, expect your application and designations to be reviewed closely. If the application does not contain an evidentiary basis for the order’s necessity and if the designations are not limited to only those parts of the documents that need to be protected, you may not get a sealing order. Put yourself in the position of the judge in evaluating whether the statutory requirements are met.[9:418.4] Reserved. 4. Applicationa. [9:418.5] Matters that may qualify for sealing: Only the specific words of documents that constitute the sensitive material should be sealed; generally, it is not permissible to seal the entire document. Examples of documents that may include information that may warrant sealing are:• [9:418.6] Documents containing trade secrets. [In re Providian Credit Card Cases (2002) 96 CA4th 292, 300, 116 CR2d 833, 839 (dictum); McGuan v. Endovascular Tech., Inc. (2010) 182 CA4th 974, 988, 106 CR3d 277, 289—quality control records and complaint handling procedures]• [9:418.7] Documents containing material protected by a privilege. [Huffy Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.), supra, 112 CA4th at 108, 4 CR3d at 834—attorney-client privilege (dictum)]• [9:418.8] Confidential settlement agreement. [Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Unity Pictures Corp.) (2003) 110 CA4th 1273, 1283, 2 CR3d 484, 493 (dictum)]But the parties’ agreement to keep materials confidential (such as in a stipulated protective order or other agreement) is never enough, standing alone, to support sealing. [CRC 2.551(a)]• [9:418.9] Documents containing personal information subject to a right of privacy. [In re M.T. (2024) 106 CA5th 322, 336-342, 326 CR3d 808, 819-824][9:418.10 - 9:418.14] Reserved.b. [9:418.15] Where sealing not permitted: Examples of documents that were ordered not to be sealed are:• [9:418.16] That litigants are celebrities and subject to media attention does not justify closing the proceedings (so presumably the mere fact that the documents pertain to a celebrity would not support sealing the document). [NBC Subsidiary (KNBC-TV), Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Locke) (1999) 20 C4th 1178, 1217-1218, 86 CR2d 778, 809]• [9:418.17] Documents containing material that has been disclosed to the public cannot contain trade secrets and may not be sealed on that basis. [In re Providian Credit Card Cases (2002) 96 CA4th 292, 304, 116 CR2d 833, 842]• [9:418.18] That a document contains admissions of wrongdoing does not, solely for that reason, entitle a party to a sealing order. [Huffy Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.), supra, 112 CA4th at 108, 4 CR3d at 834]• [9:418.19] That a document contains the identity of witnesses to violations of law does not, solely for that reason, entitle a party to a sealing order. [Huffy Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.), supra, 112 CA4th at 108, 4 CR3d at 834]• [9:418.20] A settlement agreement that contains a confidentiality clause does not qualify for sealing after all references to financial and other confidential data have been redacted. [Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Unity Pictures Corp.), supra, 110 CA4th at 1284, 2 CR3d at 494; see also Huffy Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co.), supra, 112 CA4th at 107, 4 CR3d at 833—denying overbroad request to seal entire settlement agreement including “routine verbiage which appears in most settlement agreements”]• [9:418.21] Online review of an employer that described conditions of employment such as workload, office sizes, employment perquisites, “work-life balance” and complaints about such matters protected by the Labor Code should not be sealed. [Glassdoor, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Machine Zone, Inc.) (2017) 9 CA5th 623, 638, 215 CR3d 395, 408][9:418.22 - 9:418.24] Reserved.c. [9:418.25] Discovery materials: There is no right of public access to, and hence no need to seal, discovery materials exchanged between civil litigants (e.g., pretrial depositions and interrogatories). These items are not usually in the court’s files. Nor do the sealing rules of court apply to discovery motions or materials filed or lodged in court in connection with discovery motions or proceedings (e.g., confidential material subject to a protective order). [CRC 2.550(a)(3); see ¶ 9:418.27]The sealed records rules’ presumption of public access applies only to court-filed discovery materials used at trial or submitted as a basis for adjudication of matters other than discovery motions or proceedings. [CRC 2.550(a)(3); see Mercury Interactive Corp. v. Klein (2007) 158 CA4th 60, 100-101, 70 CR3d 88, 118-119; Marriage of Tamir (2021) 72 CA5th 1068, 1090-1091, 288 CR3d 48, 65-66]Discovery materials “submitted as a basis for adjudication” refers to materials submitted in support of and in opposition to substantive pretrial motions, regardless of whether those materials play any role in the trial court’s ultimate ruling on the motion. [Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (2014) 231 CA4th 471, 496, 180 CR3d 234, 256]However, there is no public right of access to documents that are irrelevant to the motion or as to which evidentiary objections are sustained. [Overstock.Com, Inc. v. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., supra, 231 CA4th at 492, 180 CR3d at 253](1) [9:418.26] Routine discovery motions; exception for questions of public importance? Although discovery motions and materials lodged or filed with the court in connection with discovery motions are generally exempt from the sealing rules (¶ 9:418.25), a right of public access may exist where the discovery motion involves “questions of great significance to members of the public.” [H.B. Fuller Co. v. Doe (2007) 151 CA4th 879, 893, 60 CR3d 501, 511—motion to quash subpoena affecting First Amendment right to speak anonymously]A protective order may require certain information or documents to be maintained confidentially and may address how they are to be handled in connection with discovery and other motions. However, the court may modify those orders in appropriate circumstances where there is a question of great public significance.➪ [9:418.27] PRACTICE POINTER: Some judges require the parties to file papers related to discovery motions in the public file, redacting matter only as determined by counsel in good faith (e.g., pursuant to a stipulated confidentiality order) to protect confidentiality, and to simultaneously file unredacted papers under seal. 5. [9:419] Compare—Motion to Unseal Records: Any party or member of the public may, upon notice to the parties, file a motion, application or petition to unseal a record. In ruling on the motion, the court must consider the same matters as on a motion to seal (see ¶ 9:418). [CRC 2.551(h); see In re Providian Credit Card Cases, supra, 96 CA4th at 302, 116 CR2d at 840-841—but express findings not required in unsealing order] The rules do not provide a time limit for making such a motion.Any judge to whom the matter has been assigned may order unsealing even if the sealing order was entered by a different judge. [See Marriage of Tamir (2021) 72 CA5th 1068, 1083-1084, 288 CR3d 48, 60]If the court proposes to unseal a record on its own motion, it must mail notice to the parties stating the reasons for the proposed unsealing. Any party may file an opposition to the unsealing within 10 days thereafter, and any other party may file a response to the opposition within five days after filing of the opposition. [CRC 2.551(h)(3)]An order unsealing records must state whether the records are unsealed entirely or in part. If the records are only unsealed in part or are unsealed only as to certain persons, the order must specify the portion unsealed and identify the persons entitled to access. [CRC 2.551(h)(5)] 6. [9:420] Compare—Procedure to Use Documents Subject to Confidentiality Agreement or Protective Order: Where a party wants to use at trial (or with a motion) documents that are subject to a confidentiality agreement or protective order, and has no interest in sealing them, the party must:— lodge the unredacted documents with the court clerk as required on a motion to seal (¶ 9:417);— file redacted copies of the documents (redacted so as to conceal the protected portions); and— give notice to opposing parties that the documents will become part of the public court file unless they file a timely motion to seal.

[9:421] Lis Pendens—In General: A lis pendens is a recorded instrument (“Notice of Pending Action”), recorded in the office of the county recorder where land is located, that gives constructive notice of a pending lawsuit affecting title to described real property. The pleadings in the lawsuit to which the lis pendens refers must describe a specific parcel of real property. [Gale v. Sup.Ct. (Gale) (2004) 122 CA4th 1388, 1395, 19 CR3d 554, 559]Anyone who acquires an interest in the described property (purchaser, mortgagee, etc.) takes that interest subject to any judgment that may be entered in the lawsuit. The practical effect is to cloud the property’s title and prevent its transfer until the litigation is resolved or the lis pendens is expunged or released. [See Kirkeby v. Sup.Ct. (Fascenelli) (2004) 33 C4th 642, 651, 15 CR3d 805, 811; J & A Mash & Barrel, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Tower Theater Properties) (2022) 74 CA5th 1, 15-16, 289 CR3d 110, 122; Mira Overseas Consulting Ltd. v.

[9:421.1] Required in certain actions: There are some actions in which recordation of a lis pendens is required by statute, including:— actions to quiet title; [CCP § 761.010]— actions for partition; [CCP § 872.250]— eminent domain proceedings; [CCP §§ 1250.130, 1250.150]— claim to escheated property; [CCP §§ 1355, 1410]— action to declare building uninhabitable; [CCP § 405.7]— forfeiture proceedings. [Fin.C. § 5321(b); Health & Saf.C. § 11488.4; Pen.C. § 186.4]Note: A lis pendens is not the exclusive remedy in such cases. Plaintiff may also seek an injunction, attachment or other provisional remedy. [CCP § 405.8]b. [9:421.2] Permitted in other actions affecting title, possession or easement: Recordation of a lis pendens is permitted in any action by a “claimant” who has a “real property claim.” [CCP § 405.1]A “real property claim” is any cause of action which, if meritorious, would affect:— title to, or the right to possession of, specific real property; or— the use of an easement identified in the pleading (other than an easement obtained pursuant to statute by any regulated public utility). [CCP § 405.4; see ¶ 9:431][9:421.3 - 9:421.4] Reserved.c. [9:421.5] Not permitted where action pending in another state: Even though the property is located in California, there is no statutory authority for recording a lis pendens in California relating to an action pending in another state. [Formula Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (iStar Fin’l Inc.) (2008) 168 CA4th 1455, 1462, 86 CR3d 341, 346]d. [9:421.6] Not permitted for arbitration: There must be an action pending in state or federal court in order for a lis pendens to be filed. A lis pendens may not be filed based on a pending arbitration involving a real property claim. [Manhattan Loft, LLC v. Mercury Liquors, Inc. (2009) 173 CA4th 1040, 1051, 93 CR3d 457, 464]➪ [9:421.7] PRACTICE POINTER FOR PLAINTIFFS: To protect your client’s rights in the property while arbitrating a real property dispute, first file an action in court that will support a lis pendens and then move to stay the litigation pending the arbitration. 2. [9:422] Procedures to “Expunge” Lis Pendens—In General: Because of the potential for abuse and injustice to the property owner, the Legislature has provided statutory procedures (CCP § 405.30 et seq.) by which a lis pendens may be removed (“expunged”). [See Shah v. McMahon (2007) 148 CA4th 526, 529, 55 CR3d 792, 795—lis pendens procedure “provides a means by which a court may dispose of meritless real estate claims at the preliminary stage of a case”; De Martini v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (2024) 98 CA5th 1269, 1275, 317 CR3d 441, 445—“Section 405.30 is intended to prevent an unwarranted clouding of a party’s title with an inappropriate or void notice of pending action”]a. [9:423] Grounds for expungement: A lis pendens may be ordered removed from the record title (“expunged”) on any of the following grounds:• Improper lis pendens: The lis pendens is improper because:— the complaint does not contain a “real property claim” [CCP § 405.31]; or— plaintiff cannot establish its “probable validity” by a “preponderance of the evidence.” [CCP § 405.32; see ¶ 9:429 ff.]• Lis pendens proper, but bond provides adequate security: Even if the “real property claim” has “probable validity,” a lis pendens will be expunged if the court finds “adequate relief” can be “secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking.” [CCP § 405.33; see ¶ 9:440 ff.]• Defect in service or filing: Alternatively, defects in statutory service and filing requirements are ground for expungement. [See CCP § 405.23; McKnight v. Sup.Ct. (Faber) (1985) 170 CA3d 291, 303, 215 CR 909, 915 (decided under former law); see also J & A Mash & Barrel, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Tower Theater Properties) (2022) 74 CA5th 1, 24-25, 27-28, 289 CR3d 110, 129, 131-132—service on partner of partnership owner was proper; and ¶ 9:453 ff.]b. [9:424] Compare—voluntary withdrawal: The lis pendens claimant may voluntarily withdraw it at any time by recording an acknowledged “notice of withdrawal.” [CCP § 405.50] (An acknowledgment before a notary public is required; see Civ.C. § 1181 et seq.)➪ [9:424.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Voluntary withdrawal is generally required as part of any settlement or dismissal. It should also be considered by plaintiff if serious weaknesses develop in plaintiff’s case. Withdrawing the lis pendens may mitigate whatever damages the property owner may later claim in a malicious prosecution, slander of title or contract action.c. [9:425] Moving party: Normally, defendant (property owner) is the moving party. But anyone else having an interest in the property (e.g., mortgagee, tenant, etc.) has standing even if not named as a party. [CCP § 405.30]A nonparty, however, must seek leave to intervene before the motion to expunge can be filed. [CCP § 405.30]d. [9:426] Timing: A motion to expunge may be filed “at any time” after the lis pendens is recorded. [CCP § 405.30](1) [9:426.1] While judgment on appeal: If grounds for expungement exist (CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32), the motion may be made in the trial court even while an appeal is pending. [Peery v. Sup.Ct. (Beneficial Standard Properties) (1981) 29 C3d 837, 842, 176 CR 533, 536 (decided under former law)]If the claimant lost at trial, the lis pendens must be expunged unless the trial court is willing to find its own decision will probably be reversed on appeal (a highly unlikely situation). [Mix v. Sup.Ct.(Behniwal) (2004) 124 CA4th 987, 996, 21 CR3d 826, 833]e. [9:427] Moving papers: Requirements applicable to noticed motions generally apply to a motion to expunge—i.e., notice of motion, supporting evidence, points and authorities and proof of service (see ¶ 9:28 ff.).• FORM: Motion to Expunge Lis Pendens and Proposed Order, see Form 9A:27 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).f. [9:428] Discovery: The court may make any orders necessary to provide for discovery by any party “affected” by the motion to expunge. [CCP § 405.30]Comment: Although the matter is unclear, “affected” party presumably means either the moving party (defendant) or the opposing party (plaintiff).(1) [9:428.1] Effect of defendant claiming privilege? If defendant refuses to provide discovery on key issues (e.g., by invoking the privilege against self-incrimination), plaintiff’s evidentiary burden (see ¶ 9:429 ff.) arguably should be excused. But the point is unsettled. [See Klein v. Sup.Ct. (Thomas) (1988) 198 CA3d 894, 915, 244 CR 226, 239 (decided under former law)] 3. [9:429] Motion to Expunge Improper Lis Pendens: A lis pendens will be expunged without a bond if the court finds either:• Plaintiff’s complaint does not contain a “real property claim” (i.e., one affecting title or possession of specific real property or use of an easement, etc.; CCP § 405.4). [CCP § 405.31 (emphasis added)]• Or, the claimant “has not established by a preponderance of the evidence the probable validity of the real property claim.” [CCP § 405.32 (emphasis added)]a. [9:430] Burden of proof on lis pendens claimant (plaintiff): Unlike most other motions, the burden of proof is on the party opposing the motion to expunge. The lis pendens claimant (plaintiff) bears the burden of establishing the existence of a “real property claim” and that it is “probably valid.” [CCP § 405.32]Plaintiff thus has the burden of producing sufficient evidence to support a finding that plaintiff will “probably” win at trial.b. [9:431] Proving existence of “real property claim”: The allegations of the complaint determine whether a “real property claim” is involved; no independent evidence is required. [Urez Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Keefer) (1987) 190 CA3d 1141, 1149, 235 CR 837, 842 (decided under former law); De Martini v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (2024) 98 CA5th 1269, 1278, 317 CR3d 441, 448—court must engage in a “demurrer-like analysis, asking whether the claimants have pled facts entitling them to the remedy they seek” (internal quotes omitted); CCP § 405.31]A “real property claim” is any cause of action which, if meritorious, would affect:— title to, or the right to possession of, specific real property; or— the use of an easement identified in the pleading (other than an easement obtained pursuant to statute by any regulated public utility). [CCP § 405.4](1) [9:432] Application: The following are actions which may “affect title or possession” of real property for lis pendens purposes:• [9:432.1] Specific performance: A buyer’s suit to compel specific performance of a contract for sale of real property. [Hilberg v. Sup.Ct. (Mendrin) (1989) 215 CA3d 539, 542, 263 CR 675, 677 (decided under former law); De Martini v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (2024) 98 CA5th 1269, 1278, 317 CR3d 441, 448]• [9:432.2] Declaratory relief: A suit for declaratory relief as to rights in real property. [Mason v. Sup.Ct. (Bond) (1985) 163 CA3d 989, 996, 210 CR 63, 67—whether ambiguous provision in deed created a condition subsequent or was merely a covenant (decided under former law)]• [9:432.3] Easements: Suits to enforce or determine easement rights in real property. [CCP § 405.4(b); Woodcourt II Ltd. v. McDonald Co. (1981) 119 CA3d 245, 247-248, 173 CR 836, 837—lis pendens on servient tenement (decided under former law); Park 100 Investment Group II v. Ryan (2009) 180 CA4th 795, 809, 103 CR3d 218, 227—easement dispute is real property claim affecting title and right to possession of both dominant and servient properties]• [9:432.4] Leaseholds: A lis pendens may be filed in an action to enforce or determine ownership of a leasehold interest in real property. [Parker v. Sup.Ct. (Dwight) (1970) 9 CA3d 397, 399-400, 88 CR 352, 353-354—marriage dissolution involving leasehold in real property (decided under former law)]• [9:432.5] Fraudulent conveyances: A suit to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of real property. [Kirkeby v. Sup.Ct. (Fascenelli) (2004) 33 C4th 642, 649, 15 CR3d 805, 809-810; Hunting World, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Bogar) (1994) 22 CA4th 67, 72, 26 CR2d 923, 926 (citing text)]• [9:432.6] Marriage dissolution: A marriage dissolution proceeding in which ownership of real property is at issue. [Kane v. Huntley Fin’l (1983) 146 CA3d 1092, 1096, 194 CR 880, 882—Wife’s failure to record lis pendens allowed Husband to encumber home held in both names but which was her separate property (decided under former law); Mabie v. Hyatt (1998) 61 CA4th 581, 589, 71 CR2d 657, 661, fn. 5—same]Cross-refer: For further discussion of lis pendens in marriage dissolution actions, see Hogoboom & King, Cal. Prac. Guide: Family Law (TRG), Ch. 3.• [9:432.7] Mechanic’s lien foreclosure: A lis pendens is expressly authorized by statute in suits to foreclose mechanics’ liens (including material suppliers, contractors, etc.; see Civ.C. § 9100). [Civ.C. § 8461]—. [9:432.8] The lis pendens creates a lien only for the amounts due under the mechanic’s lien, not for attorney fees or other amounts claimed under a contract cause of action joined in the mechanic’s lien foreclosure action. [Abbett Elec. Corp. v. California Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n (1991) 230 CA3d 355, 362, 281 CR 362, 366 (decided under former law)]• [9:432.9] Probate action challenging validity of trust amendments naming successor trustee: In an action challenging trust amendments that changed the trustee and trust beneficiary, and the trustee had used trust assets to purchase real property, the petition, if successful, would affect a change in title to the property, so a lis pendens could be filed against the trust property. [Newell v. Sup. Ct. (Rollins) (2024) 107 CA5th 728, 735-738, 328 CR3d 322, 327-329](2) [9:433] Compare—actions not affecting title or possession: It is not enough that the action merely relates to real property. The following are illustrative:• [9:433.1] To satisfy a debt, defendant promised to convey property to plaintiff if certain contingencies occurred. They never occurred. Plaintiff’s claimed “investment” in the property was merely a contract debt and could not support a lis pendens. [Deane v. Sup.Ct. (Fischer) (1985) 164 CA3d 292, 296, 210 CR 406, 408 (decided under former law)]• [9:433.2] Several limited partners sued general partners for breach of fiduciary duty in transferring partnership real property. Plaintiffs’ interest was in the partnership, not the property, and therefore their suit did not affect “title or possession” of the property for lis pendens purposes. [North Coast Business Park v. Sup.Ct. (Jones) (1984) 158 CA3d 858, 860, 205 CR 81, 82 (decided under former law)](3) [9:434] Compare—actions seeking equitable lien to enforce monetary claim: Although there are earlier cases to the contrary, it is now well established that a lis pendens is not proper in a creditor’s action to impose a constructive trust or equitable lien on real property solely as a means of enforcing a debt. The action does not “affect title” because the creditor claims no present interest in the property. [BGJ Assocs., LLC v. Sup.Ct. (M2B2, LLC) (1999) 75 CA4th 952, 972, 89 CR2d 693, 706; Lewis v. Sup.Ct. (Folksam Gen. Mutual Ins. Soc.) (1994) 30 CA4th 1850, 1864, 37 CR2d 63, 73; Campbell v. Sup.Ct. (La Barrie) (2005) 132 CA4th 904, 911, 34 CR3d 68, 72][9:435] Reserved.c. [9:436] Proving “probable validity” of claim: To avoid a motion to expunge under CCP § 405.32, the burden is on the lis pendens claimant (plaintiff) to establish the “probable validity” of the real property claim “by a preponderance of the evidence.” [CCP § 405.32; J & A Mash & Barrel, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Tower Theater Properties) (2022) 74 CA5th 1, 32-33, 289 CR3d 110, 136]Plaintiff may offer documentary or testimonial evidence. (This is one of the few motions on which oral evidence is normally received.)(1) [9:436.1] “Probable validity”: “Probable validity” means “it is more likely than not that the [plaintiff] will obtain a judgment against the defendant on the claim.” [CCP § 405.3 (emphasis added)](2) [9:436.2] Judge weighs evidence: If conflicting evidence is presented, the judge must weigh the evidence in deciding whether plaintiff has sustained its burden. This “requires a minitrial on the merits for making a probable validity finding” rather than conducting a quasi demurrer-like analysis. [De Martini v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (2024) 98 CA5th 1269, 1279-1280, 317 CR3d 441, 449—claimant must make more than a prima facie case regarding real property claim]d. [9:437] Ruling on motion: Expungement of an improper lis pendens is mandatory, not discretionary. Thus, if the court finds the underlying claim is not a “real property claim” or that its “probable validity” has not been established “by a preponderance of the evidence,” it must order the lis pendens expunged. [CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32](1) [9:437.1] No bond if expungement granted: The court may not order defendant to give an undertaking before expunging an improper lis pendens. [CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32](2) [9:437.2] Bond may be ordered if expungement denied: If the lis pendens is proper (i.e., underlying claim is a “real property claim” and its “probable validity” is established by a “preponderance” of evidence), the court still has discretion to order an undertaking as a condition of allowing the lis pendens to remain of record. [CCP § 405.34; see ¶ 9:448](3) [9:438] Compare—judgment against claimant on appeal: Where a judgment has been entered against the claimant on the underlying real property claim, but the claimant has filed an appeal, the motion to expunge must be granted unless the court finds it more likely than not that the appellate court will reverse the judgment. [Amalgamated Bank v. Sup.Ct. (Corinthian Homes) (2007) 149 CA4th 1003, 1015, 57 CR3d 686, 693-694][9:439] Reserved. 4. [9:440] Motion to Expunge Proper Lis Pendens Where Undertaking Provides Adequate Relief: Although the lis pendens is proper (i.e., court finds the real property claim has probable validity), it may still be expunged if the court finds “adequate relief can be secured to the claimant by the giving of an undertaking” (bond). [CCP § 405.33]➪ [9:440.1] PRACTICE POINTER: This motion should always be made as an alternative to a motion to expunge on the ground the lis pendens is improper (CCP §§ 405.31, 405.32, ¶ 9:437). Doing so avoids unnecessary return trips to court. More importantly, it gives the court some flexibility; i.e., the court has no discretion to deny expungement when CCP § 405.31 (lack of “real property claim”) or CCP § 405.32 (lack of “probable validity”) grounds are established. But it does have discretion in fixing the amount of the bond upon which expungement can be ordered under CCP § 405.33.a. [9:440.2] Purpose: The bond “allows the defendant to dispose of the property subject to suit while remaining capable of responding in damages to the plaintiff’s claim.” [On v. Cow Hollow Properties (1990) 222 CA3d 1568, 1573, 272 CR 535, 537 (decided under former law)]b. [9:440.3] Burden of proof on moving party (defendant): The statute does not say which party has the burden of proving whether a bond would be “adequate relief.” But the Code Comment to § 405.30 expressly states the burden is on the moving party. [See Stewart Develop. Co. IV v. Sup.Ct. (Property Investments West, Inc.) (1980) 108 CA3d 266, 272, 166 CR 450, 453 (decided under former law)]c. [9:441] Whether undertaking “adequate relief”: Expungement will not be ordered unless a bond will secure “adequate relief” to plaintiff (CCP § 405.33). A bond is “adequate relief” if it will indemnify plaintiff against all resulting damage from removing the lis pendens. [See Sheets v. Sup.Ct. (Devcorp) (1978) 86 CA3d 68, 70-71, 149 CR 912, 914 (decided under former law)](1) [9:441.1] Single family residences: Theoretically, every parcel of land is “unique” and money cannot compensate for loss of an interest therein (see Civ.C. § 3387). But for purposes of determining whether a bond will provide “adequate” security for expungement, the presumption that land is “unique” applies only to a single family residence that plaintiff intends to occupy. [CCP § 405.33]With regard to a single family residence that plaintiff intends to occupy, the presumption is conclusive. [Civ.C. § 3387](2) [9:442] Other property: In all other cases, the adequacy of a bond must be determined by extrinsic factors, such as:— the nature and extent of plaintiff’s claim;— plaintiff’s purpose in acquiring the property;— whether the property has unique characteristics (beyond the legal “uniqueness” of all real property);— whether the property is likely to be transferred or encumbered during litigation; and— whether any such purchaser or encumbrancer is likely to take without notice of plaintiff’s claim. [See Stewart Develop. Co. IV v. Sup.Ct. (Property Investments West, Inc.) (1980) 108 CA3d 266, 274, 166 CR 450, 454—expungement denied where buyer was interested in property for development purposes, rather than for just monetary gain (decided under former law)]d. [9:443] Amount of undertaking: Expungement may be ordered upon posting an undertaking “of such nature and in such amount” that will indemnify plaintiff “for all damages proximately resulting from the expungement” that plaintiffs may incur if they win the case. [CCP § 405.33 (emphasis added)](1) [9:443.1] Effect: Only those damages “resulting from the expungement” need be considered. The value of the land itself and plaintiff’s claimed interest therein are only factors in determining what damages would result from the expungement if plaintiff ultimately prevails in establishing an interest in the property. [See CCP § 405.33](2) [9:443.2] Damages on other claims not covered: If plaintiff loses on the lis pendens claim but wins on another cause of action (that does not support recordation of a lis pendens), the judgment cannot be satisfied out of the undertaking. Such damages do not proximately result from the expungement. [See CMSH Co., Inc. v. Antelope Develop., Inc. (1990) 223 CA3d 174, 272 CR 605, 609 (decided under former law)]e. [9:444] Form of undertaking: The undertaking must be in a form sufficient under the “Bond and Undertaking Law” (CCP § 995.010 et seq.). That law requires generally either a bond or undertaking from an admitted surety insurer or personal sureties (with sufficient qualifications), or a cash deposit in lieu thereof. [See CCP §§ 995.510, 995.610, 995.710](1) [9:444.1] No other security: The court has no power to “waive” these requirements—e.g., by allowing defendant to execute a trust deed in favor of plaintiff in lieu of an undertaking. It makes no difference that defendant has no other security and is therefore unable to obtain an undertaking. [Markley v. Sup.Ct. (Samuels) (1992) 5 CA4th 738, 752, 7 CR2d 328, 336 (decided under former law)]f. [9:445] Procedural considerations: An expungement ordered under § 405.33 is conditioned on the moving party posting the designated undertaking by a specified “return date.” On that day, the moving party must show the required undertaking has been provided. Otherwise, the motion to expunge will be denied “without further notice or hearing.” [CCP § 405.33](1) [9:445.1] Continuance? Whether this permits a continuance of the hearing is unclear.➪ [9:445.2] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid any question, ask the court to set a “return date” far enough out to permit hearing on any objections to the sufficiency of the undertaking.(2) [9:445.3] Objections to sufficiency of undertaking: Objections to the sufficiency of the undertaking must be resolved as provided in CCP § 995.010 et seq.Cross-refer: See detailed discussion in Ahart, Cal. Prac. Guide: Enforcing Judgments & Debts (TRG), Ch. 6H.[9:446 - 9:447] Reserved. 5. [9:448] Compare—Motion for Undertaking as Condition of Lis Pendens: Instead of posting a bond itself to obtain expungement, defendant may move the court to require plaintiff to provide an undertaking as a condition of keeping the lis pendens in effect. [CCP § 405.34]Any party having an interest in the property (e.g., lenders, tenants, etc.) may seek such security. However, nonparties must seek leave to intervene before filing the motion. [CCP § 405.34]a. [9:448.1] Burden of proof on moving party (defendant): See discussion at ¶ 9:440.3.b. [9:449] Amount of undertaking: The undertaking will be “of such nature and in such amount as the court may determine to be just.” [CCP § 405.34]The court will usually set an amount high enough to cover whatever damages the moving party is likely to suffer if the lis pendens is not removed. [See Elder v. Carlisle Ins. Co. (1987) 193 CA3d 1313, 1319, 238 CR 897, 901 (decided under former law)]This may include:• [9:449.1] Carrying costs of property: The taxes, interest cost and expenses of maintaining the property while lis pendens clouds title; and if property is declining in value, lost profits on resale. [See CMSH Co., Inc. v. Antelope Develop., Inc. (1990) 223 CA3d 174, 181, 272 CR 605, 610 (decided under former law but principle still valid)]• [9:449.2] Attorney fees and costs: It may also include attorney fees and costs in removing the cloud on title: “The bond would in fact have limited and uncertain value if the defendant could not use it to collect attorneys’ fees and costs in the successful defense of the action.” [On v. Cow Hollow Properties (1990) 222 CA3d 1568, 1573, 272 CR 535, 538 (decided under former law)]• [9:449.3] Compare—no damages resulting from inflation: But damages caused by inflation and the resulting loss of purchasing power of money may not be recoverable. Reason: The lis pendens was not the cause of inflation. [CMSH Co., Inc. v. Antelope Develop., Inc., supra, 223 CA3d at 181-183, 272 CR at 610-611]• [9:449.4] Compare—no malicious prosecution damages: Similarly, damages from malicious prosecution (e.g., emotional distress, punitive damages) are not considered in assessing damages recoverable under the undertaking. [See CCP § 405.34 (last sent.)]c. [9:450] Procedural considerations: The procedure for providing an undertaking is substantially the same as discussed above with respect to motions under CCP § 405.33 (¶ 9:445 ff.).[9:451 - 9:452] Reserved. 6. [9:453] Motion to Expunge for Defects in Service or Filing Lis Pendens: Although the statute does not expressly authorize expungement because of defects in service or filing of the lis pendens, these grounds are recognized by case law. [McKnight v. Sup.Ct. (Faber) (1985) 170 CA3d 291, 303, 215 CR 909, 915 (decided under former law)] (The Code Comment to CCP §§ 405.23 and 405.30 also states expungement may be ordered for such defects.)However, a lis pendens need not be expunged to be deemed “void and invalid” under CCP § 405.23 due to defects in service or filing. [Carr v. Rosien (2015) 238 CA4th 845, 857, 190 CR3d 245, 253 (lis pendens declared void due to lack of mail notice)—“Legislature did not intend to require that a void lis pendens be expunged”; see Rey Sanchez Investments v. Sup.Ct. (Pch Enterprises, Inc.) (2016) 244 CA4th 259, 263, 197 CR3d 575, 578—lis pendens without proof of service may be deemed void without expungement motion]a. [9:453.1] Compare—technical defects: However, it may be an abuse of discretion to expunge a lis pendens solely for a “technical” defect in service, at least where defendant has actual notice of the lis pendens. [Biddle v. Sup.Ct. (Paulson) (1985) 170 CA3d 135, 137, 215 CR 848, 849 (decided under former law); J & A Mash & Barrel, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Tower Theater Properties) (2022) 74 CA5th 1, 29, 289 CR3d 110, 133—“substantial compliance” with CCP § 405.22 mailing requirements suffices]• [9:453.2] P mailed a copy of lis pendens to D’s business address, but not his residence address, by first class mail (violating the requirement that notice be mailed with return receipt requested to “all known addresses”; see CCP § 405.22). But D had actual notice and moved to expunge (on other grounds) within 5 days after the lis pendens was recorded. It was an abuse of discretion to expunge at a later date for technical defects in the original service of lis pendens. [Biddle v. Sup.Ct. (Paulson), supra, 170 CA3d at 137, 215 CR at 849]b. [9:454] Compare—defects waived by delay: Moreover, procedural defects may be waived where the moving party unreasonably delays asserting these grounds. [Biddle v. Sup.Ct. (Paulson), supra, 170 CA3d at 137, 215 CR at 849—ground first raised more than one year after notice received; compare Rey Sanchez Investments v. Sup.Ct. (Pch Enterprises, Inc.), supra, 244 CA4th at 265, 197 CR3d at 579—78-day delay did not warrant refusal to expunge void lis pendens]c. [9:455] Supporting material; burden of proof; filing and service requirements, etc.: The rules applicable to motions and evidentiary hearings in general apply. [CCP § 405.30, Code Comment, para. 3; CCP § 1005 et seq.; Ev.C. § 500]d. [9:456] Refiling after expungement: Once a lis pendens has been expunged for any reason (including defects in service or filing), leave of court is required to re-record the lis pendens. [CCP § 405.36; see Ward v. Sup.Ct. (Beverlywood Homes Ass’n) (1997) 55 CA4th 60, 66, 63 CR2d 731, 734, fn. 3; De Martini v. Sup.Ct. (Gupta) (2024) 98 CA5th 1269, 1277-1278, 317 CR3d 441, 448—after expungement in first action, leave of court required for second lis pendens even though it was in subsequent action, because lis pendens was by same claimant against same property based on suit involving same parties] 7. [9:457] Expungement Order: An attorney order will be required because the expungement order must be drafted in form suitable for recording.➪ [9:457.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Make sure your expungement order identifies all parties and the litigation, and the recording information on the lis pendens being expunged. Title insurance companies can “nit-pick” any ambiguity and refuse to insure.If your client has a sale or transfer pending, show the title company a draft of your order before presenting it to the court for execution. Ask the title officer whether any additional language is required to satisfy the title company so that the lis pendens will not be shown as an “exception” in the title policy.a. [9:458] When recordable: The expungement order is not effective and may not be recorded “until the time within which a petition for writ of mandate may be filed … has expired.” [CCP § 405.35 (20 days after service of notice of order, unless extended for up to 10 days)]➪ [9:458.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Ask opposing counsel to waive notice on the record. If counsel refuses, serve your notice of order immediately upon entry of the order to start the 20-day period running.Unless there is clear authority to challenge the expungement order, plaintiff’s counsel should consider executing an immediate voluntary withdrawal of the lis pendens. Doing so may mitigate the damages defendant may later seek against plaintiff; see ¶ 9:424 ff.(1) [9:458.2] Effect of premature recordation? Whether an expungement order is effective if recorded before expiration of the 20-day period is unclear.b. [9:459] Effect of recording expungement order: Upon recordation of a certified copy of the expungement order, the lis pendens ceases to have any effect. It no longer provides actual or constructive notice of the matters stated therein or a duty of inquiry to anyone dealing with the property. [CCP § 405.60]Thereafter, and until the ultimate judgment in the action is recorded, no one other than the named parties to the action takes subject to plaintiff’s claims in the lawsuit. [See CCP § 405.61—“It is the intent of the Legislature that this section shall provide for the absolute and complete free transferability of real property after the expungement or withdrawal of a notice of pendency of action” (emphasis added)]The effect is that a subsequent purchaser takes title unencumbered by the judgment ultimately rendered in the action in which the lis pendens was recorded. [FDIC v. Charlton (1993) 17 CA4th 1066, 1069-1070, 21 CR2d 686, 689](1) [9:459.1] Actual knowledge irrelevant: Except for named parties, CCP § 405.61 provides for “absolute and complete free transferability” of property after expungement of the lis pendens. Nonparty purchasers take free and clear of the claims involved in the lawsuit, even if they had actual knowledge thereof and would have been subject thereto had a lis pendens not been filed. [CCP § 405.61; Knapp Develop. & Design v. Pal-Mal Properties, Ltd. (1987) 195 CA3d 786, 790, 240 CR 920, 923 (decided under former law but same rule under present statute)]• [9:459.2] For example, Buyer 1 sues Vendor for specific performance and records a lis pendens. Vendor has the lis pendens expunged. Vendor may freely convey the subject property to Buyer 2, even though Buyer 2 knows of the underlying lawsuit and has been “waiting in the wings” to purchase the property for more money.• [9:459.3] Compare—if no lis pendens filed: This is one of the main disadvantages of a lis pendens because if Buyer 1 had never recorded the lis pendens, Buyer 2 would be subject to the judgment in the underlying action because Buyer 2 had actual knowledge of the lawsuit. [See CCP § 1908(a)(2)—judgment binding on successors in interest who have actual or constructive notice of action](2) [9:460] No basis for claiming fraud: CCP § 405.61 relieves purchasers of “actual knowledge” following expungement of a lis pendens only for purposes of transferability of title. It does not permit a purchaser to sue for fraudulent misrepresentations or nondisclosure of matters as to which the purchaser had actual knowledge at the time of purchase. [Bishop Creek Lodge v. Scira (1996) 46 CA4th 1721, 1735, 54 CR2d 745, 752-753][9:461 - 9:462] Reserved. 8. [9:463] Attorney Fees and Costs to Prevailing Party: The court is required to “direct” an award to the prevailing party of the reasonable attorney fees and costs of making or opposing the motion unless it finds that either:— “the other party acted with substantial justification”; or— “other circumstances make the imposition of attorney’s fees and costs unjust.” [CCP § 405.38 (emphasis added); J & A Mash & Barrel, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Tower Theater Properties) (2022) 74 CA5th 1, 42, 289 CR3d 110, 144]This is the same standard applicable to rulings on discovery motions. See discussion at ¶ 8:1960 ff.a. [9:463.1] Prevailing party: The “prevailing party” is determined with the motion’s objective in mind:(1) [9:463.2] Improper lis pendens: A motion to expunge under CCP §§ 405.31 or 405.32 places in issue whether the lis pendens was proper. The court’s ruling on this issue automatically decides who is the “prevailing party” for purposes of fees and costs. [See Trapasso v. Sup.Ct. (Majdali) (1977) 73 CA3d 561, 570, 140 CR 820, 825 (decided under former law)](2) [9:463.3] Bond adequate security: But a defendant moving to expunge under § 405.33 (bond as adequate security) is the “prevailing” party only if the court orders a bond in the same amount or less than offered by defendant. If the court orders a greater amount, plaintiff is the “prevailing” party. [See Trapasso v. Sup.Ct. (Majdali), supra, 73 CA3d at 570, 140 CR at 825 (decided under former law)]b. [9:464] Against losing party, not counsel: The prevailing party on a motion to expunge is entitled to an award only against the losing party. There is no provision for an award against the losing party’s attorneys as sanctions or otherwise. [Doyle v. Sup.Ct. (Jacinth Develop., Inc.) (1991) 226 CA3d 1355, 1359, 277 CR 630, 632 (decided under former law)]c. [9:465] Effect of withdrawing lis pendens before hearing on motion to expunge: A “practical approach” is followed in determining the “prevailing party” when a lis pendens is withdrawn before the hearing on the expungement motion. The court must determine the merits of the motion and the extent to which each party has realized its litigation objective. Thus, even if the expungement motion was meritorious, attorney fees may be denied if the court finds the lis pendens claimant acted with “substantial justification” in withdrawing the lis pendens (e.g., following settlement) or other circumstances render imposition of sanctions “unjust.” [Castro v. Sup.Ct. (California Sav.) (2004) 116 CA4th 1010, 1024-1025, 10 CR3d 865, 875-876] 9. [9:466] Appellate Review: The only remedy to challenge an order made in expungement proceedings, including fee awards, is to petition for a writ of mandate within 20 days of notice of the order. Such orders are not appealable. [CCP § 405.39; Shah v. McMahon (2007) 148 CA4th 526, 529, 55 CR3d 792, 794—fee award not appealable as sanction under CCP § 904.1] [9:467 - 9:499] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[8:57] Effect of foreign injunction limiting discoveryl. [8:57.2] Foreign subpoenas contrary to California public policyAlthough very broad, the right to discovery is not absolute. There are several important limitations to consider—some contained in the Discovery Act itself, and others resulting from other laws: a. [8:39] Limit on scope of discovery: The information sought must be (1) “not privileged,” (2) “relevant to the subject matter” of the action, and (3) either itself admissible or “reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” [CCP § 2017.010; see ¶ 8:65 ff.]Courts also may restrict discovery based on the burden on the producing party. [Williams v. Sup.Ct. (Marshalls of CA, LLC), supra, 3 C5th at 549, 220 CR3d at 487 (citing CCP § 2017.020(a)); see ¶ 8:42, 8:73 ff.] b. [8:39.1] Limits on when discovery may be sought: There are several limitations on the time when discovery may be sought:(1) [8:39.2] Requirement that action be “pending”: First, a “pending action” is required. [CCP § 2017.010; Department of Fair Employment & Housing v. Sup.Ct. (Young) (1990) 225 CA3d 728, 732, 275 CR 156, 159](a) [8:39.3] Compare—before suit filed: Special procedures exist for perpetuation of testimony or other evidence prior to filing suit. However, a prior court order is required to obtain such discovery. [CCP § 2035.010 et seq., ¶ 8:422](b) [8:39.4] Compare—pending appeal: Similar procedures allow perpetuation of evidence while an appeal is pending. Again, a prior court order is required. [CCP § 2036.010 et seq., ¶ 8:431](c) [8:39.5] Compare—after judgment, in aid of money judgment enforcement: The Enforcement of Judgments Law (EJL, CCP § 680.010 et seq.) allows judgment creditors to serve judgment debtors with written interrogatories and requests for inspection and copying “to aid in enforcement of the money judgment.” No prior court order is required; but there are limits on how often such discovery may be propounded. [CCP §§ 708.020, 708.030; see SCC Acquisitions, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Western Albuquerque Land Holdings, LLC) (2015) 243 CA4th 741, 752, 196 CR3d 533, 542—§ 708.030 permits judgment creditor to compel production of third party’s documents in judgment debtor’s possession, custody or control]In addition, a subpoena duces tecum may be issued to a third party for production of records in its possession to be used in connection with a judgment debtor examination. [CCP §§ 708.110, 708.130; Shrewsbury Mgmt., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Boucher) (2019) 32 CA5th 1213, 1226-1228, 244 CR3d 595, 603-605]Cross-refer: CCP §§ 708.020 and 708.030 postjudgment discovery is discussed in detail in Ahart, Cal. Prac. Guide: Enforcing Judgments & Debts (TRG), Ch. 6G.1) [8:39.5a] Not nonmoney judgments: The above EJL postjudgment discovery procedures (¶ 8:39.5) are unique because they apply although there is no pending action; but they apply only in aid of enforcing a money judgment and are not available for the enforcement of a nonmoney judgment until a proceeding is commenced to enforce that judgment. [CCP §§ 708.010(a), 708.020(a), 708.030(a); see Department of Fair Employment & Housing v. Sup.Ct. (Young), supra, 225 CA3d at 732, 275 CR at 159—absent judgment creditor’s initiation of contempt proceeding to enforce judgment for injunctive relief, “there is no action pending” and thus no right to obtain discovery in aid of enforcing the judgment (emphasis added)](2) [8:39.6] Discovery “hold” at outset of action: Plaintiffs (but not defendants) must obtain a court order based on a showing of “good cause” to initiate various forms of discovery during the first 10 days (20 days for depositions; 5 days for other forms of discovery in unlawful detainer cases) after defendant is served with summons or has appeared in the action. [CCP §§ 2025.210(b) (depositions), 2025.270(b), (d) (depositions), 2030.020(b), (c) & (d) (interrogatories), 2031.020(b), (c) & (d) (demands for documents, etc.), 2033.020(b), (c) & (d) (requests for admission)] (See discussion at ¶ 8:439, 8:906.)Every section of the Discovery Act pertaining to any method of discovery enumerated in § 2019.010 et seq. is subject to a holding period after service on a defendant (or requires that the party to whom the discovery is directed has been served with the summons and complaint). [California Shellfish, Inc. v. United Shellfish Co. (1997) 56 CA4th 16, 22, 64 CR2d 797, 799](3) [8:39.6a] Discovery “hold” while anti-SLAPP motion pending: A special motion to strike can be used to challenge SLAPP lawsuits (CCP § 425.16; see ¶ 7:500 ff.). Filing such motion automatically stays all discovery proceedings until the court’s ruling, unless (for good cause shown on noticed motion) the court allows specified discovery limited to issues raised by the motion in the interim. [CCP § 425.16(g); see Britts v. Sup.Ct. (Berg & Berg Enterprises, LLC) (2006) 145 CA4th 1112, 1125, 52 CR3d 185, 192—stay applies to discovery motions pending when anti-SLAPP motion filed; and further discussion at ¶ 7:1095 ff.](4) [8:39.7] Discovery “cut-off” after judicial arbitration: If a trial de novo is demanded after an arbitration award in a case that was ordered to arbitration, the only additional discovery permitted without a court order or stipulation is an exchange of expert witness lists and expert witness depositions under CCP § 2034.210 et seq. (see ¶ 8:1624 ff.). [CCP § 1141.24; see ¶ 13:152]This limitation on postarbitration discovery does not apply, however, where judicial arbitration was by stipulation or election, rather than by court order (see ¶ 13:152.2).(5) [8:39.8] Discovery “cut-offs” before trial: Subject to some exceptions, a court order is required to conduct most types of discovery within 30 days before trial or to have discovery motions heard within 15 days before trial. [CCP § 2024.020(a); see ¶ 8:445]There are, however, other pretrial cut-off deadlines for certain types of actions (see ¶ 8:446 ff.); and special pretrial cut-offs for expert witness discovery in any civil action (15 days before trial for discovery and 10 days before trial for discovery motions to be heard; CCP § 2024.030, see ¶ 8:447).(6) [8:39.9] Time constraints on discovery before summary judgment motion: Defendants contemplating a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion need to conduct discovery early in the action because many lawsuits must be resolved within 365 days after filing, and a summary judgment or summary adjudication motion generally must be heard at least 30 days prior to trial (see ¶ 10:71) after at least 75 days’ notice of hearing (see ¶ 10:77).The time available for discovery before seeking summary judgment may be further curtailed if defendant files an anti-SLAPP motion because discovery is automatically stayed until the ruling (see ¶ 8:39.6a); or a motion to quash service of summons (see ¶ 3:376) because defendants may refuse to engage in nonjurisdictional-related discovery while the motion is pending.(7) [8:39.10] Compare—time limits on discovery no bar to informal investigation: The discovery “hold” and “cut-offs” do not affect a party’s right to conduct informal investigations; e.g., to interview nonparty witnesses, to visit premises open to the public, to obtain copies of public records, etc. [See Pullin v. Sup.Ct. (Vons Companies, Inc.) (2000) 81 CA4th 1161, 1165, 97 CR2d 447, 450, fn. 4; County of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Axelrad) (2000) 82 CA4th 819, 829, 98 CR2d 564, 571] c. [8:40] Geographic limits: There are some geographic limits on discovery: e.g., a witness cannot be compelled to travel more than a certain distance to give deposition testimony. [CCP § 2025.250(a)-(d); see ¶ 8:621 ff.] d. [8:41] Protective orders: The court is authorized to limit discovery through protective orders. Such orders may be granted on motion of any party or other person affected by the discovery sought (but not on the court’s own motion). [CCP §§ 2017.020(a), 2019.020(b), 2019.030(a)](1) [8:42] To limit scope of discovery: Even if the information sought is “relevant to the subject matter,” the court shall limit the scope of discovery if it determines that the “burden, expense, or intrusiveness … clearly outweighs the likelihood that the information sought will lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.” [CCP § 2017.020(a) (emphasis added); see ¶ 8:73](2) [8:43] To limit frequency or extent of use of any discovery method: A protective order may also be granted to restrict the frequency or extent of use of any discovery method, on any of the following grounds:• “The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative;• “[It] is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome or less expensive;• “The selected method of discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into account the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the issues at stake in the litigation.” [CCP § 2019.030(a)(1)-(2) (emphasis added)](3) [8:44] To limit particular procedures: The statutes authorizing the various discovery procedures (depositions, interrogatories, etc.) also provide for protective orders limiting such procedures in particular ways. Such orders may be granted as “justice requires” to protect any party or person from “unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense.” (For example, protective orders re depositions are authorized by CCP § 2025.420; see ¶ 8:501 ff., 8:642, 8:1008.1.)(4) [8:45] Procedure: The procedure to obtain protective orders is discussed at ¶ 8:685 ff. and 8:1013 ff. (The moving party must show “a good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally; and sanctions may be imposed against the losing party.)[8:45.1 - 8:45.4] Reserved.(5) [8:45.5] Limits on stipulated protective orders in elder abuse cases: In actions for abuse of an elder or dependent adult under Welf. & Inst.C. § 15600 et seq., information acquired through discovery that is evidence of abuse may be filed with the court and made part of the public record despite a stipulated protective order. [See CCP § 2017.320]This prevents secret agreements to hide patterns of abuse by health care providers and the alleged abusers’ identities from regulatory agencies and residents’ families.Limited to Welf. & Inst.C. § 15600 et seq. actions: This provision (CCP § 2017.320) applies only in actions for elder abuse under Welf. & Inst.C. § 15600 et seq. It does not apply to information obtained through discovery in professional negligence actions against a health care provider. [CCP § 2017.320(h)](a) [8:45.6] Procedures required for public disclosure: Before evidence subject to a stipulated protective order may be made part of the public record, however, the following procedures are required:• At least one week before filing the information with the court, the party proposing to file it must offer to “meet and confer” with the party from whom the information was obtained (presumably to seek agreement re public disclosure);• If a document is involved, information not evidence of elder abuse must be redacted;• The party filing the information with the court must give concurrent notice of the filing “and its basis” (e.g., statutory and policy reasons for disclosure) to the party from whom the information was obtained;• Any affected party then has 30 days within which to seek a protective order, based on a showing of good cause, to prevent the evidence of elder abuse from becoming part of the public record (the information remains confidential during the 30-day period). [CCP § 2017.320(b)-(e)]1) [8:45.6a] Comment: The parties are free to stipulate not to file the papers. (CCP § 2016.030 permits the parties to “modify the procedures” in § 2017.320.) The propounding party may not be interested in such a stipulation, however, if it plans to use the information as evidence.(b) [8:45.7] Ruling on application to prevent public disclosure: Confidential settlement agreements are disfavored in elder abuse cases (CCP § 2017.310). A stipulated protective order will not prevent public disclosure of information filed with the court unless the court finds either:— the information is not evidence of elder abuse;— the information is privileged; or— the party seeking to prevent public disclosure has demonstrated a substantial probability that prejudice will result from such disclosure and that party’s interest cannot adequately be protected through redaction. [CCP § 2017.320(f)]1) [8:45.8] Redacting required where public disclosure allowed: If the court denies the petition to prevent public disclosure, the court must redact any part of the filed information it finds is not evidence of elder abuse. [CCP § 2017.320(g)]However, the name of the defendant should not be redacted from any information made available to the public. [CCP § 2017.320(g)] e. [8:46] Limit on discovery from foreign nationals—international comity: International comity requires American courts to exercise “special vigilance” to protect foreign litigants or witnesses from unnecessary or unduly burdensome discovery that might put them in a disadvantageous position. Their objections to discovery should receive “most careful consideration” to demonstrate “due respect for any special problem confronted by the foreign litigant on account of its nationality or the location of its operations, and for any sovereign interest expressed by a foreign state.” [Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct. (1987) 482 US 522, 546, 107 S.Ct. 2542, 2557](1) [8:47] Location of evidence not controlling: The fact that the evidence is located in this country, or that it is under the “control” of a party, is not determinative. I.e., the fact that an American court may have the power to order a foreign national to produce evidence does not mean such power should be exercised in every case. [See Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct., supra, 482 US at 546, 107 S.Ct. at 2557](2) [8:48] Case-by-case determination: The exact line between “reasonable” and “abusive” discovery must be drawn by the trial court based on the particular facts of the case and the foreign interests involved. [Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct., supra, 482 US at 546, 107 S.Ct. at 2557](a) [8:49] “Intrusiveness” as factor: However, the Supreme Court has noted that some discovery procedures are “much more intrusive than others.” For example, in a wrongful death case against a foreign airplane manufacturer, an interrogatory asking the manufacturer simply to identify its test pilots, or requests to admit that certain advertising claims were authorized, were “certainly less intrusive than a request to produce all of the design specifications, line drawings and engineering plans …” [Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct., supra, 482 US at 545, 107 S.Ct. at 2556 (internal quotes omitted)](3) [8:50] Hague Evidence Convention procedures optional: The U.S. and various other countries (including Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom) have signed the “The Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters.” (The Convention and a list of signatories, together with suggested forms, can be found following 28 USC § 1781.)The Hague Convention authorizes a judicial authority in one signatory country to send “letters of request” through government channels to a “central authority” in any other signatory country (with translations and detailed descriptions of whatever documents or information are sought). That “central authority” then determines what methods and procedures may be used to obtain the information sought. [See “Legal Resources” on the U.S. Department of State website, www.travel.state.gov]However, the Hague Convention is merely a permissive supplement—not a replacement—for other means of discovery. It is up to American courts to decide whether parties should be required to use these procedures in lieu of regular discovery methods. [Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct., supra, 482 US at 536, 107 S.Ct. at 2551-2552; American Home Assur. Co. v. Societe Commerciale Toutelectric (2002) 104 CA4th 406, 425, 128 CR2d 430, 445](a) [8:50.1] Burden of persuasion: The foreign litigant bears the burden of persuading the court that comity considerations require use of the Hague Convention discovery procedures. [American Home Assur. Co. v. Societe Commerciale Toutelectric, supra, 104 CA4th at 428, 128 CR2d at 447][8:50.2 - 8:50.4] Reserved.(b) [8:50.5] Waiver: The foreign litigant’s failure to raise a “formal objection” or to seek a protective order waives its right to compel reliance on the Hague Convention procedures. [American Home Assur. Co. v. Societe Commerciale Toutelectric, supra, 104 CA4th at 429, 128 CR2d at 448](c) [8:51] Discovery from nonparties: The Hague Convention is particularly helpful in cases involving foreign witnesses or custodians of record who are not otherwise subject to personal jurisdiction in the U.S. [Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. United States Dist.Ct., supra, 482 US at 536, 107 S.Ct. at 2551-2552](d) [8:52] Orders facilitating: The party seeking discovery may seek appropriate court orders facilitating compliance with the Hague Convention “letters of request” procedure. E.g., it may order the opposing party to provide the necessary translations and descriptions of particular documents or evidence sought.➪ [8:52.1] PRACTICE POINTER: The Hague Convention allows participating countries to refuse to grant “letters of request” designed to obtain pretrial discovery of documents. Accordingly, when you draft the “letter of request,” avoid using the term “pretrial discovery” and emphasize that the requested discovery will be used for trial purposes.(e) [8:53] Comment: As a practical matter, the Hague Convention procedures are more cumbersome than federal and state discovery rules. In addition, because each signatory country applies its own rules and procedures, discovery results may be unpredictable. As a result, courts are not likely to require the Hague Convention procedures except where there is no other way to obtain the information sought.(4) [8:54] Inter-American Convention: Similar procedures are found in the “Inter-American Convention on Letters Rogatory” entered into between the U.S. and many Latin American countries (plus Spain).The Inter-American Convention and list of signatories, together with sample forms, can be found following 28 USC § 1781.[8:54.1 - 8:54.4] Reserved. f. [8:54.5] Federal highway safety reports: Certain surveys, studies and reports for the purpose of federal highway safety improvements “shall not be subject to discovery or admitted into evidence in a Federal or State court proceeding.” [23 USC § 407 (emphasis added); see Pierce County, Wash. v. Guillen (2003) 537 US 129, 145-146, 123 S.Ct. 720, 730-731—auto accident reports privileged if obtained by road department for highway safety purposes, but not if collected by sheriff for law enforcement purposes (construing predecessor statute)] g. [8:54.6] Emails stored on ISP facilities: Subject to enumerated exceptions, the Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits Internet service providers (ISPs) from disclosing the content of emails stored on their facilities (18 USC § 2702(a)(1)). This provision has been held to excuse an ISP from disclosing, in response to a discovery subpoena, both the contents of an email and the author’s identity. [O’Grady v. Sup.Ct. (Apple Computer, Inc.) (2006) 139 CA4th 1423, 1447-1448, 44 CR3d 72, 89-90; but see Negro v. Sup.Ct. (Navalimpianti USA, Inc.)

Sup.Ct. (Touchstone) (2020) 10 C5th 329, 361, 267 CR3d 267, 291]However, where a social media entity’s contract with its user permits the entity to access and use the content for its own business purposes, the SCA does not apply, and the information is subject to subpoena. “[T]he companies’ ability to access and use their customer’s information takes them outside the strictures of the [SCA].” [Snap, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Pina) (2024) 103 CA5th 1031, 1038, 1062-1066, 323 CR3d 576, 582, 601-605, rev.grntd. 9/18/24 (Case No. S286267) (cited pursuant to CRC 8.1115(e))—in criminal context, social media posts by alleged violent crime victim showing violent character was sufficient to show good cause for production of social media company’s posts, but information should not be disclosed directly to defendant, rather produced to court for in camera review pursuant to Pen.C. § 1326(d)] h. [8:55] Limited discovery in limited civil cases: Economic litigation rules limit discovery in limited civil cases. See discussion at ¶ 8:1806 ff. i. [8:56] No discovery in small claims actions or appeals: No discovery at all is permitted in small claims actions, nor in trial de novo proceedings in superior court on appeal of a small claims judgment. [CCP §§ 116.310(b), 116.770(b)] j. [8:56.1] No discovery where prohibited by federal law: Where federal law clearly and expressly prohibits discovery of specific information, state discovery rules are preempted.

Similarly, a state court subpoena cannot be enforced against a federal employee where the federal agency has adopted regulations prohibiting the employee from testifying or producing records. [Houston Bus. Journal, Inc. v. Office of Comptroller of Currency, U.S. Dept. of Treasury (DC Cir. 1996) 86 F3d 1208, 1211-1212]➪ [8:56.3] PRACTICE POINTER: If you seek documents from a nonparty federal agency that refuses to provide them voluntarily, your remedy is to file a collateral action against the agency in federal court under the Federal Administrative Procedure Act (see 5 USC §§ 701-706); or possibly a mandamus action against the agency head.

[15 USC § 78u-4(b)(3)(D); see Newby v. Enron Corp. (5th Cir. 2003) 338 F3d 467, 472] k. [8:57] Effect of foreign injunction limiting discovery: The parties’ discovery rights cannot be limited by an injunction, issued by an out-of-state court in unrelated proceedings to which they were not parties, that seeks to suppress discoverable evidence. Such an injunction is not entitled to full faith and credit in California litigation brought by strangers to the out-of-state proceedings; the California court is free to determine for itself that witnesses are competent to testify and what evidence is discoverable in the California proceeding. [Baker by Thomas v. General Motors Corp. (1998) 522 US 222, 237-238, 118 S.Ct. 657, 666; Smith v. Sup.Ct.

As part of the settlement, the Michigan court permanently enjoined Engineer from testifying as an expert witness against GM in any other litigation, either at deposition or at trial. Plaintiff sought to depose Engineer in unrelated litigation in California. The Michigan injunction did not limit discovery in the California proceeding. [Smith v. Sup.Ct. (General Motors), supra, 41 CA4th at 1025, 49 CR2d at 26] l. [8:57.2] Foreign subpoenas contrary to California public policy: California courts must not enable certain discovery connected with sister state proceedings when they violate California public policy on gender affirming care or abortion rights.

I.e., the case need not be “at issue.” [Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young & Co. (1990) 223 CA3d 1429, 1436, 273 CR 262, 265—sanctions upheld for refusal to make discovery because demurrer pending] a. [8:59] Discovery after demurrer sustained: Deficiencies in the pleadings generally do not affect either party’s right to conduct discovery. Thus, for example, discovery may continue after a demurrer has been sustained with leave to amend, although no amended complaint has yet been filed—i.e., no valid complaint need be on file. [Budget Finance Plan v. Sup.Ct. (McDowell) (1973) 34 CA3d 794, 797, 110 CR 302, 304]Plaintiff may need discovery in such a case in order to draft the amendment. (And, defendant may wish to pin down the nature of plaintiff’s claim without waiting until the amended complaint is filed.) [See Union Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Scott) (1978) 80 CA3d 1, 12, 145 CR 316, 322]However, the court likely has discretion to disallow discovery without a valid complaint (see ¶ 8:76 ff.).(1) [8:59.1] Court’s discretion to stay: The result may be different where plaintiff has already had opportunity for discovery, and there is no showing further discovery would enable plaintiff to state a valid claim. Under those circumstances, the court may (discretionary) stay discovery pending amendment of the complaint (see ¶ 8:76.1). [Terminals Equip. Co. v. City & County of San Francisco (1990) 221 CA3d 234, 247, 270 CR 329, 337](2) [8:59.2] Anti-SLAPP stay of discovery: During the pendency of an anti-SLAPP motion to strike, no discovery may be had without court order. See ¶ 7:1095 ff. b. [8:60] Exception re trade secrets litigation: A party claiming misappropriation of a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (Civ.C. § 3426) must identify it “with reasonable particularity” before commencing discovery relating to the trade secret. [CCP § 2019.210; see Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Sputtered Films, Inc.) (2005) 132 CA4th 826, 834-835, 33 CR3d 901, 907]➪ [8:60.1] PRACTICE POINTER: If the complaint does not describe the trade secret adequately, plaintiff must provide a separate statement containing the requisite description. Before serving the separate statement, plaintiff may seek a protective order under Civ.C. § 3426.5 (e.g., “confidential—for attorneys’ eyes only” and “disclosure to defendants prohibited”).Although plaintiff cannot commence discovery until such description is provided, defendant’s right to proceed with discovery is not affected.(1) [8:60.2] Purpose: CCP § 2019.210 was enacted to prevent the party from conducting “fishing expeditions” into competitors’ business files by unfounded claims of trade secret misappropriation. It also assists the court in framing the appropriate scope of discovery and the defendant in framing its defenses. [Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Sputtered Films, Inc.), supra, 132 CA4th at 833-834, 33 CR3d at 906; Computer Economics, Inc. v. Gartner Group, Inc. (SD CA 1999) 50 F.Supp.2d 980, 985 (applying Calif. law); see Diodes, Inc. v.

Angelin (2009) 172 CA4th 133, 144, 90 CR3d 842, 848 (emphasis added; internal quotes omitted); see also Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Sputtered Films, Inc.), supra, 132 CA4th at 835-836, 33 CR3d at 908]Any reasonable doubt regarding adequacy of the description is resolved in favor of allowing discovery to proceed. [Brescia v. Angelin, supra, 172 CA4th at 145, 90 CR3d at 849](a) Application• [8:60.6] The more complex the field, the more exacting level of description may be required. Where the secret consisted of incremental advances in the state of the art in a highly specialized technical field, a greater degree of particularity was required to distinguish the alleged trade secrets from matters already known to persons skilled in that field. [Advanced Modular Sputtering, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Sputtered Films, Inc.), supra, 132 CA4th at 836, 33 CR3d at 908; Perlan Therapeutics, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Nexbio, Inc.)

Brown, Jr. (Ret.), Current edition authors, Presiding Justice Lee Smalley Edmon and Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow (Ret.)Chapter 8. DiscoveryChapter 8D. Discovery Practice—Preserving Evidence—Creating Discovery Plan7. [8:413] Proper Scheduling of Discovery:	a. [8:413.1] Plan to serve supplemental interrogatoriesb. [8:413.2] Complete discovery needed for summary judgment motionWhatever discovery devices are used, carefully consider sequence and timing so that applicable deadlines will be met. Bear in mind that subject to a few exceptions, all non-expert discovery must be completed by 30 days before the initial trial date (15 days before trial for expert discovery; see ¶ 8:1690). [CCP § 2024.020(a); see ¶ 8:445] a. [8:413.1] Plan to serve supplemental interrogatories: Because the opposing party owes no duty to update its answers to interrogatories to provide information discovered after its original answers were served (¶ 8:1118), be sure to include time in your discovery plan for serving supplemental interrogatories (see ¶ 8:942 ff.) before the discovery cutoff date. b. [8:413.2] Complete discovery needed for summary judgment motion: If you intend to file a summary judgment motion, calendar the filing deadline as soon as the court sets the initial trial date. Remember that the motion has a 75-day notice period (¶ 10:77), the motion must be heard at least 30 days before trial (¶ 10:71) and the normal time for responding to most discovery requests (e.g., interrogatories, requests for admission, inspection demands, physical or mental exams) is a minimum of 30 days. Thus, discovery will have to be served early—at least 4-1/2 months before trial—to ensure that you have all needed responses before the motion must be filed. Absent circumstances beyond your control, the court is not likely to grant a continuance of the trial date merely to give you more time to obtain needed discovery (see ¶ 10:207 ff.).➪ [8:413.2a] PRACTICE POINTER: Plan ahead. Even 4-1/2 months may not be enough time to get the responses you need for your motion. Requests for extension of time to respond are common and generally granted. If you need to obtain further responses through either a meet and confer process or a discovery motion, several months could be added to the time schedule. As a practical matter, you may need to start 8-9 months before trial to make sure your written discovery is completed. ➪ [8:413.3] FURTHER PRACTICE POINTERS: In actions where case management conferences are held, discovery deadlines may be discussed at the initial conference (¶ 12:77.5 ff.). Counsel should know the applicable case disposition guidelines, and schedule sufficient time to complete discovery and make any pretrial motions. [See CRC Standards of Jud. Admin., Standard 2.2]If the complexity of the case or unanticipated problems make completion of discovery unlikely within one year of filing the complaint, counsel should be prepared to address those issues with the trial judge at the case management conference and to argue for extended deadlines. Raising those issues with the trial judge early usually improves the chances of obtaining relief.Consider sequencing discovery (limiting discovery at the outset to particular issues) if resolving one or two issues will make the case easier to settle or determine by motion. Raise your sequencing plan with the trial judge at the first case management conference because you may need more time before the scheduled trial date to allow for sequencing. The judge is likely to look positively on any reasonable plan to resolve the matter early.[8:413.4] CAUTION RE SCHEDULING: Familiarize yourself with the motion scheduling practice in your assigned department or courtroom at the outset of your case. Many courts have adopted special rules regarding the calendaring of motions, sometimes requiring that motions be scheduled several months in advance. As a precaution, practitioners should evaluate the requirements to ensure they schedule hearing dates for discovery and summary judgment motions in order to have them heard before trial. Also, counsel should promptly cancel dates that are no longer needed so that the valuable time can be used by the court on other matters. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

And, there is a “cut-off” on discovery shortly before trial (¶ 8:445) or after judicial arbitration (¶ 8:446.3). Otherwise, depositions may be taken without leave of court at any time during the pendency of a civil action. [CCP § 2025.210(b)] ➪ [8:438] PRACTICE POINTERS: It is generally best to take depositions as soon as possible in the lawsuit, while memories are still fresh.• You may wish to precede the deposition by other discovery procedures: e.g., interrogatories to flush out the adversary’s claims and contentions; and demands for documents so that you will be prepared to question the deponent about them.• But take your depositions as soon as you can. It gives you a better chance of pinning down opposing parties before they learn the theory of your case and “refine” their testimony.• Some defense lawyers like to take plaintiff’s deposition before answering or otherwise pleading in response to the complaint. This sometime results in obtaining admissions that prevent later amendments to the complaint when defendant demurs or moves to strike. Also, since defendant has not yet revealed its affirmative defenses, plaintiff may not be well prepared on defensive matters (e.g., facts indicating estoppel or running of statute of limitations).• Caution: But don’t take depositions before you are prepared to do so. Under the Discovery Act, a natural person cannot be deposed more than once without court permission (CCP § 2025.610(a)-(b), see ¶ 8:478). So, if you rush into depositions without adequate preparation, you may waste your right to depose the deponent. (You can always ask the court for permission to depose the same witness again, but don’t count on getting it.) a. [8:439] “Hold” on depositions by plaintiff at outset of case: Defendants may serve notice of deposition any time after they are served or appear in the action. But plaintiffs may not serve deposition notices until 20 days after service of summons or appearance of any defendant. [CCP § 2025.210(b)]Since at least 10 days’ notice is required for depositions (¶ 8:491), this means no depositions can actually be taken by plaintiff without leave of court until at least 30 days after a defendant has been served or appeared in the action.(1) [8:440] Scope: CCP § 2025.210(b) applies to all discovery by deposition, including business records subpoenas to nonparties (see ¶ 8:540). [California Shellfish, Inc. v. United Shellfish Co. (1997) 56 CA4th 16, 21, 64 CR2d 797, 799—improper to serve business records subpoena before serving any defendant with summons and complaint](2) [8:441] Purpose: This rule prevents plaintiffs from overwhelming defendants with discovery before they have a chance to obtain counsel, commence investigations, etc. [See Waters v. Sup.Ct. (Hughes Tool Co.) (1962) 58 C2d 885, 892, 27 CR 153, 156](3) [8:442] Effect—defendant’s initial priority: As the party “attacked” in the lawsuit, defendant is given the “first crack” at taking depositions if desired. By sending out notice of deposition promptly after being served, defendants can set their depositions before the 20-day “hold” on plaintiff’s depos expires. (Note: The mere fact that defendant notices a deposition first does not necessarily assure priority, however; it is the date on which the depo is set that controls; see ¶ 8:494 ff.)Caution: Propounding discovery before filing a motion to quash waives a defendant’s right to object to personal jurisdiction (see ¶ 3:158.1c).(4) [8:443] Expiration of “hold” after summons served on ANY defendant? The statute says plaintiff can serve a deposition notice 20 days after the service on or appearance by “any defendant.” [CCP § 2025.210(b)]Arguably, as long as one defendant has been served more than 20 days ago, there is no “hold” on deposing later-served defendants: i.e., P might serve D1, wait 20 days, and then serve D2 with summons, complaint and notice of D2’s deposition 10 days later. However, a more reasonable interpretation of the statute is that the 20-day hold applies to each defendant served.Comment: Whether the statute will be given the earlier interpretation is doubtful because it would destroy D2’s initial deposition priority (¶ 8:442). In any event, a court is likely to grant a protective order in such cases.Additionally, it has been suggested that if the complaint names only “Doe” defendants and is not served on anyone, the 20-day period may not commence running until someone is served. [See Bernson v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Calif., Inc. (1994) 7 C4th 926, 930, 30 CR2d 440, 442, fn. 2](5) [8:444] Earlier depo by leave of court: For “good cause” shown, the court may authorize plaintiff to serve a deposition notice before expiration of the 20-day hold period. Such order may be granted on ex parte application. [CCP § 2025.210(b)]One such situation might be where plaintiff does not know the names of all parties responsible for the injury and wants to find this out before the statute of limitations runs. [See Bernson v. Browning-Ferris Indus. of Calif., Inc. (1994) 7 C4th 926, 930, 30 CR2d 440, 442, fn. 2] b. [8:445] “Cut-off” on discovery before trial: The Discovery Act imposes two separate “cut-offs” on discovery. Unless otherwise ordered:• Discovery proceedings must be “completed” 30 days before the date initially set for trial (¶ 8:448); and• Discovery motions must be heard no later than 15 days before the date initially set for trial. [CCP § 2024.020(a)] (With respect to retrials, see ¶ 8:451.)Extension for weekends, holidays: If either of these dates falls on a Saturday, Sunday or judicial holiday (see CCP § 10), the last day shall be the next court day closer to the trial date. (E.g., where the 30-day or 15-day before trial period falls on a weekend, the cut-off date is the following Monday, not the preceding Friday.) [CCP §§ 2016.060, 2024.020(a); see Pelton-Shepherd Indus., Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 CA4th 1568, 1585, 82 CR3d 64, 76]No earlier cut-off under local rules or court order: Local rules or court orders may not impose shorter time limits for discovery than provided by the Discovery Act. [Gov.C. § 68616(f); see Wagner v. Sup.Ct. (General Motors Corp.) (1993) 12 CA4th 1314, 1319, 16 CR2d 534, 537—discovery “cut-off” invalid where no trial date had been set] (Even so, some courts at the case management conference routinely ask counsel to stipulate to an earlier discovery cut-off; and some case management report forms include such stipulation. Benefits of these stipulations include more time after discovery to prepare for summary judgment and expert discovery, carefully considered in limine motions, and providing time for meet and confer after formal discovery responses are provided, while still leaving time for regularly noticed motion practice (see ¶ 8:449).)“Complex” cases: The court may establish special time limits and discovery schedules in cases which have been determined to be “complex.” [CRC Standards of Jud. Admin., Standard 3.10(d)](1) [8:446] Exceptions: These “cut-off” dates do not apply to:(a) [8:446.1] Unlawful detainer actions: (in which discovery, including depositions, must be completed at least 5 days before trial). [CCP §§ 2024.040(b)(1), 2025.270(b); see ¶ 8:493.2](b) [8:446.2] Eminent domain proceedings: (expert witness discovery and exchange of valuation data permitted until 20 days before trial; see CCP § 1258.020). [CCP § 2024.040(b)(2)](c) [8:446.3] Cases set for judicial arbitration: Court rules govern the time limit for completing discovery in cases set for judicial arbitration. These rules require that all discovery be completed 15 days before the date set for the arbitration hearing (unless the court orders otherwise for good cause shown). [CCP § 2024.040(a); CRC 3.822(b); see ¶ 13:96]1) [8:446.4] Limit on postarbitration discovery: After a judicial arbitration award in a case ordered to arbitration, if a trial de novo is demanded, the only additional discovery permitted without a court order or stipulation is an exchange of expert witness lists and expert witness depositions under CCP § 2034.010 et seq. [CCP §§ 2024.040(a), 1141.24; see ¶ 13:152](However, this does not apply where judicial arbitration was by stipulation or election, rather than by court order; see ¶ 13:152.2.)➪ [8:446.5] PRACTICE POINTER: Where it appears likely that the judicial arbitration may result in a settlement, attorneys often stipulate to leave certain discovery open until after the arbitration. (Such a stipulation is expressly permitted by CCP § 1141.24.) When entering into such a stipulation, be sure it is in writing and identifies the scope of the remaining discovery.(2) [8:447] Special “cut-off” dates on expert witness discovery: Because the expert witnesses who will testify at trial may not be disclosed until shortly before trial (through exchange of expert witness lists under CCP § 2034.010 et seq.; see ¶ 8:1639 ff.), special rules apply:• Discovery proceedings pertaining to expert witnesses identified under CCP § 2034.010 et seq. may be “completed” until 15 days before the initial trial date; and• Motions concerning such discovery may be heard until 10 days before the initial trial date. [CCP § 2024.030](3) [8:448] When proceedings “completed”: Discovery proceedings are deemed “completed” on the day a deposition begins. Other discovery procedures (interrogatories, RFAs, etc.) are deemed “completed” the day the response is due. [CCP § 2024.010]Thus, as long as depositions commence before the “cutoff,” they may be continued and completed within the 30-day period preceding trial.But there is no additional time for motions to compel if questions are not answered.➪ [8:449] PRACTICE POINTER: It’s very risky to schedule depositions or other discovery proceedings close to the 30-day cut-off period. If the deponent refuses to answer questions or respond, you may not be able to set a motion to compel for hearing before the 15-day cut-off on discovery hearings. You can seek a court order shortening time but don’t count on the request being granted.To be safe, serve your last round of interrogatories or requests for admission at least 90 days before trial; and schedule your last depositions no later than 60 days before trial. That way, you will have time to evaluate the answers and responses and, if necessary, to set a motion to compel for hearing before the 15-day cut-off on discovery motions.(4) [8:450] Continuance of trial does not reopen discovery: The 30-day and 15-day “cut-offs” are measured from the first date set for trial of the case. A continuance or postponement of the trial does not operate to reopen discovery proceedings. [CCP § 2024.020(b); see Pelton-Shepherd Indus., Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 CA4th 1568, 1575, 82 CR3d 64, 69, fn. 10]➪ [8:450.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Whenever the trial date is continued, be sure to make an assessment of the status of your discovery. If you still need more discovery, get the other side to stipulate, or the court to order, that the discovery cutoff dates are also continued.(5) [8:451] Effect of mistrial, new trial or reversal of judgment: A mistrial, new trial or reversal of the judgment on appeal automatically restarts the time limitations on discovery. Discovery is reopened and the “cut-off” dates are thereafter measured from the date set for retrial. [Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 C4th 245, 247, 92 CR2d 70, 71; Beverly Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Castaneda) (1993) 19 CA4th 1289, 1294, 24 CR2d 238, 240 (citing text); Hirano v. Hirano (2007) 158 CA4th 1, 6, 69 CR3d 646, 649-650](a) [8:451.1] Rationale: CCP § 2024.020(a) states that the “cut-off” is measured from the “date initially set for trial” (emphasis added). But “initially” simply means the first date set for trial of the action, and when a retrial has been ordered, it means the scheduled retrial date. [Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell), supra, 22 C4th at 250, 92 CR2d at 74; Beverly Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Castaneda), supra, 19 CA4th at 1293, 24 CR2d at 240 (citing text)](b) [8:451.2] Compare—discovery limits not affected: Reopening discovery for a retrial does not change applicable limits on discovery. Thus, unless the court orders otherwise:— persons previously deposed may not be deposed again (CCP § 2025.610(a)-(b), see ¶ 8:478);— including those previously served, no more than 35 specially prepared interrogatories and no more than 35 RFAs not relating to genuineness of documents may be served on an opposing party (CCP §§ 2030.030(b), 2033.030(a), see ¶ 8:1269). [Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell), supra, 22 C4th at 254, 92 CR2d at 77](6) [8:452] Parties may stipulate to later discovery: The parties may stipulate to extend the time for completion of discovery proceedings or for hearing discovery motions; or to reopen discovery after the trial date has been continued. Such stipulation, however, does not require the court to postpone or continue the trial date. [CCP § 2024.060]➪ [8:453] PRACTICE POINTER: If your stipulation involves a hearing after the “cut-off” date, ask the law and motion judge to approve your stipulation upon execution. Otherwise, even if no continuance of the trial is required, the law and motion judge may simply be unwilling to hear a contested discovery matter on the eve of trial.(a) [8:454] All parties must consent: The agreement is not effective unless all parties to the action have consented. [CCP § 2024.060](b) [8:455] Writing required: The stipulation may be informal, but it must be “confirmed in a writing that specifies the extended date.” [CCP § 2024.060 (emphasis added)](Comment: The writing apparently need not be signed by all parties or counsel. A letter or email by counsel for one of the parties to all other counsel, setting forth the stipulation, would seem to suffice.)1) [8:455.1] Not filed with court: Agreements extending time, etc. are not filed with the court unless they become relevant on a motion to compel. [See CRC 3.250(a)(7)](c) [8:456] Motions to enforce stipulation subject to 15-day “cut-off”? CCP § 2024.010 et seq. is unclear on whether a motion to enforce a stipulation extending discovery is itself subject to the 15-day “cut-off” on discovery motions.(7) [8:457] Court may permit later discovery: On motion of any party, the court may allow discovery proceedings to be completed, or a discovery motion to be heard, after the “cut-off” dates above (¶ 8:445 ff.); or, it may reopen discovery after the trial has been continued to a new date. [CCP § 2024.050(a); see Pelton-Shepherd Indus., Inc. v. Delta Packaging Products, Inc. (2008) 165 CA4th 1568, 1588, 82 CR3d 64, 79—court erred in hearing motion to compel after trial postponed without first deciding whether to reopen discovery, taking into consideration CCP § 2024.050(b) factors (¶ 8:459)](a) [8:458] Procedure: The Discovery Act requires a “motion” to commence this procedure but does not specify a “noticed” motion. [See CCP § 2024.050(a)]Comment: Arguably, an ex parte application should be permitted because of the limited period of time available (within 30 days of trial). However, many courts restrict ex parte applications to those specifically authorized by law (see ¶ 9:347 ff.), which this is not. The alternative is an ex parte application to shorten the time for notice and hearing on the motion.1) [8:458.1] Declaration requirements: The motion should be accompanied by declarations covering the factors identified below (¶ 8:459), plus facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally. [CCP § 2024.050(a)] (See “attempt to resolve informally” requirement at ¶ 8:1158 ff.)2) [8:458.2] Copy of proposed discovery: Although not required by statute, it is recommended that a copy of the proposed discovery be attached to the motion to permit later discovery.(b) [8:459] Factors considered: In exercising its discretion to grant or deny the motion, the court must take into consideration any relevant matter, including the following:• The necessity and reasons for the additional discovery sought;• The diligence or lack of diligence by the party seeking discovery, and the reasons why the discovery was not completed or the discovery motion heard earlier;• Whether permitting the discovery or granting the discovery motion will likely prevent the case from going to trial on the date set, or otherwise interfere with the trial calendar or prejudice any party; and• The length of time elapsed between any date previously set and the date presently set for trial. [CCP § 2024.050(b); see Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh (2005) 131 CA4th 1342, 1351-1352, 32 CR3d 717, 722-723—nonparty attorney-deponent who failed to appear at deposition and made evasive and dilatory responses to document production subpoena was estopped from relying on cut-off date for resulting motion to compel](c) [8:460] Monetary sanction against losing party: The court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party on the motion unless it finds such party “acted with substantial justification” or “other circumstances make the imposition of the sanction unjust.” [CCP § 2024.050(c)] (Monetary sanctions on discovery motions are discussed at ¶ 8:1921 ff.)[8:461] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

(Parties who fail to do so may thereafter be barred from separate depositions of that witness; see ¶ 8:478.)• Second, it is effective by itself to compel a party or “party-affiliated” witness to appear, to testify and to produce records or other evidence in possession of a party or “party-affiliated” witness without necessity of a subpoena. [CCP § 2025.280(a); see ¶ 8:516 ff.] (Nonparty witnesses must be subpoenaed (CCP § 2025.280(b).) a. [8:484] To whom notice must be given: Notice of deposition must be served on all parties who have appeared in the action. (I.e., notice need not be served on parties named in the pleadings but who are not yet served, who are served but have not yet responded or who are in default.) [CCP § 2025.240(a)]If the deposition will be conducted using instant visual display (“real time transcription”), a copy of the notice must also be given to the deposition reporter. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(5); see ¶ 8:655.1](1) [8:485] Not filed with court: The deposing party retains the original notice with proof of service. It is not filed with the court unless it becomes relevant in a law and motion hearing. [CRC 3.250(a)(3)](The same is true for stipulations setting or extending the time for depositions; see CRC 3.250(a)(7).)(2) [8:486] Where “employment records” or “personal records” of “consumer” subpoenaed: Where an oral deposition is for the purpose of obtaining “employment records” (see CCP § 1985.6, ¶ 8:596.5) or the “personal records” of a consumer (see CCP § 1985.3, ¶ 8:580), the deposition notice must also be served on the “employee” or “consumer” if not already a party to the action. [CCP § 2025.240(b); see detailed discussion at ¶ 8:580 ff.] b. [8:487] Content of notice: The notice must state all of the following in at least 12-point type (CCP § 2025.220(a)):• The date, time and place where the deposition will be taken. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(1), (2)]• The deponent’s name, and if not a party to the action, the deponent’s address and telephone number (if known). [CCP § 2025.220(a)(3)]If the deponent’s name is not known, the notice should contain a description sufficient to identify the person or class to which the person belongs (e.g., “custodian of records of XYZ Bank”). [CCP § 2025.220(a)(3)] • If the deposition is to be recorded by audio or video technology, the notice must so state. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(5); CRC 3.1010(a)—notice of “telephone, videoconference, or other remote electronic means” required]Likewise, if the deposition is to be stenographically recorded by a machine using instantaneous (or “real time”) transcription (i.e., instant visual display of the question and testimony), the deposition notice must so state and a copy of the notice furnished to the deposition officer. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(5); see discussion at ¶ 8:660] And, if the deposing party plans to use a video recording of the deposition of a doctor or other expert witness in lieu of live testimony at trial (under CCP § 2025.620(d), see ¶ 8:892), this fact must also be stated in the notice. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(6)] • If the deponent is a corporation or other entity, the notice must describe with “reasonable particularity” the matters on which questions will be asked so that it can designate the “most qualified” persons to testify on its behalf. [CCP § 2025.230; see ¶ 8:473]• If the deponent (whether or not a party) is being required to produce documents at the deposition, the materials or category of materials, including any electronically-stored information, to be produced must be specified with “reasonable particularity.” [CCP § 2025.220(a)(4)](If the deponent is a party, the notice by itself compels production of the documents. Otherwise, a “records and testimony” deposition subpoena must be served; see ¶ 8:535.) • The notice must specify the form in which any electronically-stored information is to be produced when a particular form is desired by the requesting party. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(7)]• The notice must include a statement disclosing the existence of a contractual relationship (if known to the noticing party) between the noticing party (or third party financing any part of the litigation, see ¶ 1:385.5) and the deposition officer or entity providing the services of the deposition officer. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(8)(A)]Also, the notice must include a statement disclosing any direction from the noticing party (or third party financing any part of the litigation) to use a particular officer or entity to provide the deposition services. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(8)(B)] • If the deposition is to be via telephone, videoconference, or other remote electronic means, then, while the deponent’s counsel may be physically present with the deponent without notice, parties and other counsel must give five court days’ written notice of their intent to be physically present at the deposition. The physical presence of those other counsel and parties is subject to objection under CCP § 2025.420. [CRC 3.1010(a)(3)]• Finally, the deposition notice or the accompanying proof of service must list all parties or attorneys for parties on whom the deposition notice is being served. [CCP § 2025.240(a)]FORMS:• Notice of Deposition, see Form 8:2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).• Notice of Intent to Attend Deposition [In Person] [or] [By Remote Means], see Form 8:2.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [8:488] Deposition subpoenas to be attached to notice: If the deponent’s attendance is being compelled by deposition subpoena, a copy of the subpoena must be served with the notice of deposition. [CCP § 2025.240(c); and see ¶ 8:565](2) [8:489] “Business records” subpoena as substitute for depo notice: Copies of business records maintained by a nonparty can be obtained simply by serving a “records only” subpoena on the custodian of the records (CCP § 2020.020(b), see ¶ 8:540). The party seeking the records must serve a copy of the “records only” subpoena on all other parties to the action; and it has the same effect as a notice of deposition. [CCP § 2025.220(b)](3) [8:490] Weekdays vs. weekend: Nothing in the statute prohibits noticing a deposition on other than a normal business day. But the deponent or opposing parties may seek a protective order altering the date selected by the noticing party (¶ 8:677).➪ [8:490.1] PRACTICE POINTER: If it is necessary to depose someone on a weekend or holiday, good practice dictates clearing this in advance with all concerned. Failure to do so is likely to lead to ill will, probably to motions, and possibly to sanctions.[8:490.2 - 8:490.4] Reserved.(4) [8:490.5] Effect of provision that depo “continue day to day until completed”: A notice of deposition often states that the deposition will commence on a certain date and “continue day to day until completed.” [See Sprague v. Equifax, Inc. (1985) 166 CA3d 1012, 1041, 213 CR 69, 88—deposition could not be used at trial where deponent’s counsel refused to permit deposition to be completed on following day, because it deprived opposing counsel of opportunity to cross-examine](a) [8:490.6] Comment: It is doubtful that this boilerplate language by itself obligates a deponent to remain indefinitely. Indeed, subject to certain exceptions, CCP § 2025.290 ordinarily limits the deposition of a witness by all counsel, other than the witness’ counsel of record, to seven hours of total testimony (see ¶ 8:702 ff.).➪ [8:490.7] PRACTICE POINTER: If a deposition is likely to last more than a day, the dates should be cleared in advance with opposing counsel. Similarly, if a deposition unexpectedly cannot be completed by the end of the day and the deponent or opposing counsel is unwilling to come back the next day, a date for continuance of the deposition should be determined by agreement with the deponent and all counsel. Failing agreement, deposing counsel should seek a court order for a continued deposition based on a showing of good cause. c. [8:491] Amount of notice required: The notice must be served at least 10 days before the date set for the deposition. [CCP § 2025.270(a)](1) [8:492] Longer if served by mail, overnight delivery, fax or electronically: The regular extensions of time apply where notices are served by mail: 5 calendar days if the address and place of mailing are in California; 10 calendar days if either is in another state; 12 calendar days if the address is the Secretary of State’s address confidentiality program; and 20 days if either is in another country. [CCP §§ 2016.050, 1013(a)]The extension is only 2 court days for notices served by express mail or other method providing for overnight delivery; or by fax; or by electronic transmission or notification. [See CCP §§ 1010.6, 1013]Personal service under CCP § 1011 is also authorized (CCP § 2016.050). If personal service is made to an attorney’s office and no one is present, the papers may be left in a conspicuous place in the office between the hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. If personal service is made at a party’s residence, service must be made between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. [CCP § 1011](2) [8:493] Longer where employment or “personal records” of “consumer” subpoenaed: Where the deposition is for the purpose of obtaining employment records (see CCP § 1985.6, ¶ 8:596.5) or “personal records” of a “consumer” (see CCP § 1985.3, ¶ 8:580 ff.), it cannot proceed until 20 days after the deposition subpoena was issued. (This allows the employee or “consumer” time to seek a protective order against invasion of that person’s privacy.) [CCP § 2025.270(c); see ¶ 8:605]Comment: The statute says the 20 days run “from the issuance of the subpoena.” It would make more sense to have the 20-day period run from the date the subpoena was served. Until the statute is changed, however, counsel should assume the statute means what it says.(a) [8:493.1] Compare—depo notice to party: But a party deponent may be compelled to produce such records without a subpoena or the 20-day waiting period. The normal 10-day deposition notice compels document production by a party (see ¶ 8:516).(3) [8:493.2] Shorter in unlawful detainer actions: In unlawful detainer actions, depos must be set at least 5 days after service of the notice but not later than 5 days before trial. [CCP § 2025.270(b)](4) [8:493.3] Court may alter date: For “good cause” shown, the court may lengthen or shorten the notice or time for scheduling a deposition. And, where a motion for protective order is pending, the court may stay the deposition until the matter is determined. [CCP § 2025.270(d)]Such order may be granted on motion or ex parte application of the deponent or any party. [CCP § 2025.270(d)] d. [8:494] Depo priority based on notice? Ordinarily, depositions proceed in whatever order they are noticed by the parties. But questions of priority may arise where a later-served notice sets a deposition before the date set in the first-served notice.For example, on July 1, Plaintiff serves notice of Defendant’s deposition on August 15. The next day, July 2, Defendant serves notice of Plaintiff’s deposition on August 14. Both notices are timely (i.e., served more than 10 days in advance of the deposition dates). Does the fact that Plaintiff’s depo notice was served first block Defendant’s right to proceed first?(1) [8:495] Discovery Act: The Discovery Act does not recognize priority based on notice alone: Unless state or local court rules or local uniform written policy provide otherwise, “the fact that a party is conducting discovery, whether by deposition or another method, shall not operate to delay the discovery of any other party.” [CCP § 2019.020(a) (emphasis added)](a) [8:495.1] Local rules preempted: However, local rules relating to discovery are preempted by CRC 3.20(a).[8:496 - 8:496.4] Reserved.(2) [8:496.5] Civility Guidelines:— An attorney should not use discovery to harass an opposing counsel, parties or witnesses;— When another party notices a deposition for the near future, absent unusual circumstances, an attorney should not schedule another deposition in the same case for an earlier date without opposing counsel’s agreement;— An attorney should delay a scheduled deposition only when necessary to address scheduling problems and not in bad faith;— An attorney should treat other counsel and participants with courtesy and civility, and should not engage in conduct that would be inappropriate in the presence of a judicial officer. [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 9(a)]— As soon as an attorney knows that a previously scheduled deposition will or will not in fact go forward as scheduled, the attorney should notify all counsel;— An attorney who obtains a document pursuant to a deposition subpoena should, upon request, make copies of the document available to all other counsel at their expense. [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 11(e), (f)](a) [8:496.5a] Attorney oath: Upon admission to practice law, every attorney must take an oath that includes the statement: “As an officer of the court, I will strive to conduct myself at all times with dignity, courtesy and integrity.” [CRC 9.7](b) [8:496.6] Nonparty deponents: With respect to nonparty witnesses:— An attorney should be courteous and respectful in communications with nonparty witnesses;— Upon request, an attorney should extend professional courtesies and grant reasonable accommodations, unless to do so would materially prejudice the client’s lawful objectives;— An attorney should take special care to protect a witness from undue harassment or embarrassment and to state questions in a form that is appropriate to the witness’ age and development;— An attorney should not issue a subpoena to a nonparty witness for inappropriate tactical or strategic purposes, such as to intimidate or harass the nonparty. [State Bar of California Attorney Guidelines of Civility and Professionalism § 11(a)-(d)]➪ [8:496.7] PRACTICE POINTER: Even if the witness agrees to attend voluntarily, a deposition subpoena should be served to assure the witness’ attendance at the agreed-upon date. Otherwise, you run the risk of sanctions if the witness fails to show up for any reason (see ¶ 8:824).(3) [8:497] Comment: Even in the absence of statutory authority or rule, many judges will order depositions to be taken and completed in the order noticed. Protective orders (¶ 8:501 ff.) may be granted to prevent a party from unilaterally altering the sequence of depositions (e.g., by obtaining a continuance of the party’s deposition and then noticing a deposition of the opponent). [See Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 CA3d 96, 106, 260 CR 369, 374, fn. 10]➪ [8:498] PRACTICE POINTER: “Playing games” with deposition sequence is a poor tactic. It undermines professionalism. Equally important, it is sure to raise the antagonism level in the case, making further proceedings more costly and settlement more difficult.[8:499 - 8:500] Reserved.(4) [8:501] Protective orders available: If an issue as to priority of depositions arises, a protective order may be sought under either of the following provisions:• “[F]or good cause shown, the court may establish the sequence and timing of discovery for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice.” [CCP § 2019.020(b); see ¶ 8:678]• “The court, for good cause shown, may make any order that justice requires to protect any party … from unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression, or undue burden and expense. This protective order may include… the following directions:(1) That the deposition not be taken at all. (2) That the deposition be taken at a different time … (5) That the deposition be taken only on certain specified terms and conditions.” [CCP § 2025.420(b); see ¶ 8:677] (a) [8:502] Procedure: The procedure for obtaining protective orders is discussed at ¶ 8:685 ff. A noticed motion is required; and it must include a declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution” of the matters in controversy. Monetary sanctions may be imposed against the losing party. [See CCP § 2025.420(a), (h); and further discussion at ¶ 8:2070 ff.](b) [8:503] Disadvantage of being deposed first not “good cause” for protective order: As explained by the Supreme Court: “Since discovery proceedings can seldom if ever be conducted simultaneously, it is inherent in such proceedings that the party who secures discovery first may derive advantages by securing information from his adversary before he is required to reciprocate by divulging information to him … [T]he existence of such advantages alone will ordinarily not constitute good cause for changing the normal timing of discovery or justify a conclusion that such timing will result in ‘annoyance, embarrassment or oppression.’” [Rosemont v. Sup.Ct. (Turner) (1964) 60 C2d 709, 714, 36 CR 439, 442 (emphasis added)](c) [8:504] Comment: Protective orders are, of course, discretionary. In deciding whether to alter the sequence of depositions, courts apply a practical judgment as to whether any real harm would result to either side from allowing the other to proceed first. e. [8:505] Stipulations re notice: Unless the court orders otherwise, the statutory notice requirements for all discovery methods, including deposition notices, may be altered by written stipulation. [CCP § 2016.030]➪ [8:506] PRACTICE POINTER: It is good practice to confer with other counsel in the case before setting depositions. (Indeed, this courtesy is required under “Codes of Professionalism” adopted by many bar associations and courts; see list of guidelines on civility and professionalism available on the State Bar website (www.calbar.ca.gov).) Doing so may avoid rescheduling depositions because of unavailability of the witness or counsel and other duplication of effort and will avoid expensive and time-consuming motions. However, negotiations should not go on so long that you run out of time to complete your discovery. If necessary, seek the court’s assistance through an informal discovery conference or motion to compel (see ¶ 8:787 ff.).In any event, however, do not rely on oral stipulations. Counsel frequently set depositions by oral stipulation, waiving the requirement of formal notice entirely. While this may be common, it is not a good practice because the statute (CCP § 2016.030) requires a writing for the stipulation to be enforceable.If counsel stipulate to a date for the deposition, a formal notice of deposition should be served for the agreed date. This will avoid any risk of misunderstanding as to what was agreed upon; and will assure sufficiency of notice if you have to enforce discovery. If the opposing party fails to appear for deposition, it will put you in a better position to seek sanctions for your expenses (see ¶ 8:819 ff.). And, it will avoid your being subject to sanctions for expenses incurred by other parties attending the deposition (see ¶ 8:825 ff.).[8:506.1 - 8:506.4] Reserved.(1) [8:506.5] Effect of “notice of unavailability”: Some attorneys serve a “notice of unavailability” to indicate intended vacations, etc., to deter opposing counsel from scheduling depositions or other proceedings in their absence. Such a notice has no legal effect, however, and does not entitle anyone to a continuance. [See Carl v. Sup.Ct. (Coast Comm. College Dist.) (2007) 157 CA4th 73, 75, 68 CR3d 566, 567 (dealing with practice in appellate courts)]➪ [8:506.6] PRACTICE POINTER: Even so, it is good practice to notify your opponents in advance when you will be unavailable. It is harassment for attorneys to schedule discovery knowing an opponent may be unable to respond, and doing so may result in sanctions. [See Tenderloin Housing Clinic, Inc. v. Sparks (1992) 8 CA4th 299, 305, 10 CR2d 371, 374]If there is any question as to opposing counsel’s willingness to accommodate your unavailability, seek a continuance from the court (by ex parte application, if necessary) before your absence. Keep in mind that properly noticed depositions may be admissible against your client even if you do not attend. f. [8:507] Procedure for challenging defects in deposition notice: Errors or defects in a deposition notice are rarely critical to the outcome of the case and, for this reason, are waived unless promptly challenged. [CCP § 2025.410(a)](1) [8:508] Written objection must be served before deposition: Any error or irregularity in the deposition notice is waived unless written objections are served specifying the defect. The objection must be served on the party noticing the deposition, and on all other parties who received such notice, at least 3 calendar days before the deposition. (If made on the third day preceding the deposition, personal service is required on the party noticing the deposition.) [CCP § 2025.410(a), (b)](Such objections are not filed with the court when served. They may be filed later, however, if they become relevant on a motion to compel; CRC 3.250(a)(3).)(a) [8:509] Example: P serves a notice of D’s deposition requiring production of “all books and records of D.” D believes this description is too general to require production. D must timely serve written objections before the deposition. If D waits until the deposition to raise the objection, it is waived; and D cannot refuse to produce the documents at the deposition on grounds they were not adequately described.(b) [8:510] Effect of timely objection: If the objection is timely made, “[a]ny deposition taken after the service of a written objection shall not be used against the objecting party … if the party did not attend the deposition and if the court determines that the objection was a valid one.” [CCP § 2025.410(b) (emphasis added)](c) [8:511] Waiver by attending? This does not say that the objecting party waives any defect in the notice by attending the depo. Depending on the objection to the notice (e.g., improper address), attendance may waive that objection, particularly if the party did not incur any cost as a result of the defect in the notice. However, if parties attend after proper objections have been made, then further proceedings should take place and the parties should deal with the objection by negotiation or further motion, if necessary.➪ [8:512] PRACTICE POINTER: If you receive a deposition notice in time to attend, it is risky (maybe foolhardy) to stay away from the deposition because of perceived errors or defects in the notice.If it is your client’s deposition, you are exposing the client and yourself to the risk of sanctions if it turns out you are wrong.If the deposition is of another party, information obtained by your adversary in your absence may lead to admissible evidence even if your objection is valid. And, the limit on number of times a natural person may be deposed (CCP § 2025.610(a)-(b), ¶ 8:478) may block your later attempt to depose the same witness.If you do not want the deposition to go forward and are willing to risk not attending, you could file a motion for protective order (¶ 8:675). Filing a motion to quash the depo notice will stay the deposition (¶ 8:513 ff.).As a practical matter, however, the effort and expense involved in such motions are rarely justified. It usually makes more sense simply to contact counsel noticing the depo and negotiate your objections.(2) [8:513] Motion to quash depo notice: After serving written objections, the objecting party may move for an order staying the deposition and quashing the deposition notice.Such motion must be accompanied, however, by a declaration of “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues informally. (This clearly requires you to call the defect to opposing counsel’s attention and give counsel the opportunity to send out proper notice, as discussed (¶ 8:515.)) [CCP § 2025.410(c)] (The “attempt to resolve informally” requirement is discussed in more detail at ¶ 8:1158 ff.)➪ [8:513.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Consider alternative procedures discussed at ¶ 8:787.1.(a) [8:514] Effect—deposition automatically stayed: Filing the motion to quash automatically stays the taking of the deposition until the matter is determined. No court order is required. [CCP § 2025.410(c)]Compare: A motion for protective order will not automatically stay a deposition; notice and hearing are required (see ¶ 8:687).(b) [8:514.1] Monetary sanction against losing party: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party on the motion unless it determines that party acted “with substantial justification” or that other circumstances make imposition of such sanctions “unjust.” [CCP § 2025.410(d); see California Shellfish, Inc. v. United Shellfish Co. (1997) 56 CA4th 16, 25-26, 64 CR2d 797, 802] (Monetary sanctions on discovery motions are discussed at ¶ 8:1921 ff.)➪ [8:515] PRACTICE POINTER: Moving to quash the deposition notice is not recommended unless the defect is critical and you have exhausted reasonable efforts to obtain a proper notice.Otherwise, even if you’re right and you win the motion, all you will accomplish is delay. The court will not grant sanctions in your favor if you did not make a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues informally. Indeed, failure to do so may subject you to sanctions for “misuses of the discovery process”—even if you win the motion (see CCP § 2023.010(i)). © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

Proper service of notice of deposition compels the opposing party to appear, to testify, and to produce documents if requested. [CCP § 2025.280(a)] a. [8:517] “Party-affiliated” witnesses: Nor is a deposition subpoena required to compel the attendance and testimony of a person who, although not a named party, is either an officer, director, managing agent or employee of a party. [CCP § 2025.280(a)](1) [8:517.1] Managing agent: A managing agent may, but need not, be an officer, director or employee of a party. For purposes of the discovery statutes, a managing agent is determined based on several factors: “(1) does the person exercise judgment and discretion in dealing with the party’s matters; (2) can the person be expected to comply with the party’s directive to appear; and (3) can the person be anticipated to identify himself or herself with the party’s interests.” [Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc. (2016) 246 CA4th 566, 602, 201 CR3d 156, 186]This determination is “highly dependent” on the specific facts of the case and the party seeking to compel the deposition has the initial burden to show the named deponent is a managing agent of the party. [Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc., supra, 246 CA4th at 601, 201 CR3d at 185—member of defendant’s “Governing Body” not a managing agent where no evidence defendant could compel deponent’s attendance for his depo](2) [8:518] Compare—former employees: The “affiliation” must exist at the time of deposition. Persons formerly affiliated with a party (e.g., former officers or employees) are not required to attend a deposition unless subpoenaed. [Maldonado v. Sup.Ct. (ICG Telecom Group, Inc.) (2002) 94 CA4th 1390, 1398, 115 CR2d 137, 143 (citing text)](3) [8:519] Notice does not confer jurisdiction over nonparty: The requirement that an “officer, director, managing agent, or employee” appear for deposition without necessity of subpoena does not mean that such persons are subject to the court’s personal jurisdiction. Rather, it means that it is the responsibility of the party to produce such persons for deposition (or risk the sanctions discussed below, ¶ 8:533 ff.).➪ [8:520] PRACTICE POINTER: If there is any question as to the witness’ present “affiliation” with a party, don’t rely on a deposition notice to compel that person’s attendance. Serve a deposition subpoena instead, or serve both the notice and a subpoena.This will avoid any argument from opposing counsel as to the witness’ status—i.e., that the witness is no longer “an officer, director, managing agent or employee” of the opposing party. (Before serving the subpoena, you can ask opposing counsel to stipulate as to the status of the witness; if the stipulation is refused, you’ll know a subpoena is necessary.) b. [8:521] Production of documents, electronically-stored information, etc. at deposition: No subpoena is required to compel a party or “party-affiliated” witnesses to produce books, records or other materials—including electronically-stored information—in their possession at the time of deposition as long as the notice of deposition specified with reasonable particularity the materials or category of materials (including any electronically-stored information) they are to produce. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(4)]Compare—CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demands: Production of documents, electronically-stored information, and other things can also be obtained through a CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demand (discussed in Ch. 8H). But these are separate procedures. Absent a protective order, neither procedure bars use of the other. [Carter v. Sup.Ct. (CSAA Inter-Insurance Bureau) (1990) 218 CA3d 994, 997, 267 CR 290, 291-292—party who missed deadline for compelling inspection under CCP § 2031.010 et seq. may compel inspection at deposition]➪ [8:521.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: If you expect the documents to be complex or voluminous, serve an inspection demand under CCP § 2031.010 et seq., scheduling the inspection before the deposition, rather than seeking production by deposition notice. It is difficult to examine complex or voluminous documents “under the gun” in a deposition setting and frame intelligent questions. You may have to ask for a recess or continuance, which will run up the cost to all concerned and may be opposed.This is particularly true with regard to electronically-stored information (ESI). Unless requesting a small amount of ESI that can readily be produced in printout form (e.g., relevant emails to or from the deponent), it makes better sense to obtain the ESI through a CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demand before the deposition. Alternatively, you should agree with the producing party to obtain the ESI called for in the notice before the oral deposition.(1) [8:522] Location of records immaterial: A party can be compelled to produce records located in another state or country if they are shown to be under the party’s control. [See Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165 CA3d 806, 810-811, 212 CR 42, 44-45—Los Angeles partner in national accounting firm subpoenaed to produce records from partnership office in New York for trial in California](2) [8:523] Sufficiency of description: The materials or category of materials, including any electronically-stored information, to be produced must be described with “reasonable particularity” in the deposition notice. [CCP § 2025.220(a)(4)]This is an objective test: i.e., whether a person of average intelligence would know what items are being sought. (Thus, “I didn’t realize what you wanted” may not be a valid excuse for failure to produce.)(a) [8:524] Compare—other document discovery methods: The same standard—“by category” and “reasonably particularizing each category”—applies to CCP § 2030.010 et seq. inspection demands (CCP § 2031.030(c)(1), ¶ 8:1439) and deposition subpoenas (CCP § 2020.510(a)(2), ¶ 8:561).[8:525] Reserved.(b) [8:526] Effect: Allowing descriptions “by category” and “with reasonable particularity” does not mean the responding party must bear the burden of going through all of its records to determine which records satisfy a broadly-worded discovery demand.Particularly where discovery is sought from a nonparty, the burden should be placed on the party seeking discovery: The description in the deposition notice therefore should bear some relationship to the manner in which the records are kept. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571; see discussion at ¶ 8:544.1 ff.]➪ [8:527] PRACTICE POINTER: From this perspective, your deposition notice should identify the subject matter or transaction in question as narrowly as possible.• Requests for “all correspondence between Jones and Smith in 2005” may suffice if the amount of correspondence between them is not too large. However, it would be better to state the subject matter you’re looking for (e.g., “relating to purchase of Smith’s house”).• But requests for “all financial records of XYZ Co.” or “all documents relating to XYZ’s liability to Jones” would seem too broad. They could embrace many subcategories completely unrelated to the litigation. A protective order (¶ 8:531.3) might be granted.[8:528] Reserved.(3) [8:529] Challenges to production: A party may challenge the demand for production of materials described in a deposition notice by various methods:(a) [8:529.1] Inadequate description: Where the description in the deposition notice is so broad that the deponent cannot identify the documents to be produced, the deponent may serve written objections at least 3 days before the deposition and may file a motion to stay the deposition and quash the notice. [CCP § 2025.410(a), (c), discussed at ¶ 8:508 ff.](b) [8:530] Unjustly burdensome: Where compliance with the demand would involve an unreasonable effort and expense, the party or party-affiliated deponent may apply to the court for a protective order under CCP § 2025.420 (see ¶ 8:675 ff.; and ¶ 8:692.5 ff. re special rules for ESI protective orders).Alternatively, the deponent can simply object on these grounds at the time of the deposition.(c) [8:531] Not permissible discovery: If the documents described are privileged, attorney work product, or not “relevant to the subject matter,” the deponent may seek a protective order; or may raise these grounds as an objection at the deposition. The examiner will then have to file a motion to compel (¶ 8:787).➪ [8:531.1] PRACTICE POINTER: A protective order is the only safe procedure to prevent production of documents by a coparty or nonparty deponent. Merely objecting at the deposition won’t prevent the deponent from turning over the documents.(4) [8:531.2] Challenges by coparty or nonparty: Even if the deponent does not seek to avoid production of the documents, another party or a nonparty to whom the records pertain may have standing to do so. (E.g., Former Wife sues Husband and Bank for conspiring to conceal community assets. She serves Bank with depo notice demanding production of Husband’s personal financial records at depo. Husband may seek to prevent disclosure even if Bank does not.)(a) [8:531.3] By protective order: Any party to the action or any person to whom the records pertain has standing to seek a protective order against disclosure of the records. [CCP § 2025.420(a)-(b); see ¶ 8:685](b) [8:531.4] By motion to quash? CCP §§ 1985.3(g) and 1987.1 authorize a motion to quash or limit a “subpoena” where a party’s personal records are sought from a records custodian (whether it is a party to the action or not). By their terms, those sections do not apply to depo notices; however, CCP § 2025.410(c) permits an objection to the notice and a motion to quash for failure to comply with the consumer notice requirements of CCP § 2025.240(b). See ¶ 8:601 ff. c. [8:532] Enforcement procedure: The party noticing the deposition may move for an order compelling discovery from a party deponent who fails to appear or answer questions or to produce materials requested in the deposition notice, and who has not served a valid objection under § 2025.410(a). [CCP § 2025.450(a); see ¶ 8:787]➪ [8:532a] PRACTICE POINTER: Consider alternative procedures discussed at ¶ 8:787.1.(1) [8:532.1] “Good cause” for production: The motion to compel must “set forth specific facts showing good cause” justifying the production for inspection of the requested document, ESI or tangible thing. [CCP § 2025.450(b)(1)] (“Good cause” is discussed in connection with CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demands; see ¶ 8:1495 ff.)(a) [8:532.2] Effect: The party noticing the deposition need not show “good cause” for inspection in the deposition notice. But the party must be prepared to do so if the deponent refuses to produce the documents, ESI or things requested. This effectively limits pure “fishing expeditions.”(b) [8:532.3] Compare—depo questions: No showing of “good cause” is required on a motion to compel answers to deposition questions. (It makes no difference that the questioner was on a “fishing trip” if the question was reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence; see ¶ 8:72.) But production of documents, ESI or things may involve a greater intrusion than testimonial compulsion. Hence, the discovery standards are heightened.[8:532.4 - 8:532.9] Reserved.(2) [8:532.10] Separate statement of disputed matters: A motion to compel (or to quash) production of documents or tangible things at a deposition must be accompanied by a separate statement setting forth the particular documents or demands at issue, the responses received, and the reasons why production should be compelled. However, a separate statement is not required if no response was provided to the requested discovery. [CRC 3.1345(a)(5), (b)](a) [8:532.11] Form and content of statement: See detailed discussion at ¶ 8:1151 ff.(b) [8:532.12] Compare—concise outline: In lieu of a separate statement, the court may direct the parties to file a “concise outline” of the discovery demands and responses in dispute. [CRC 3.1345(b)(2)—no separate statement needed “[w]hen a court has allowed the moving party to submit—in place of a separate statement—a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute”; see CCP §§ 2030.300(b)(2) (re interrogatories), 2031.310(b)(3) (re demands for inspection, copying and testing), 2033.290(b)(2) (re requests for admission); Marriage of Moore (2024) 102 CA5th 1275, 1296-1297, 322 CR3d 249, 267-268—because CRC 3.1345(b) does not require party to obtain permission before filing concise outline, appellate court inferred from trial court’s granting of motion that it exercised its inherent discretion to accept concise outline in lieu of separate statement]These outlines are designed to be shorter than separate statements, and presumably would include reasons for requested court action only once, as opposed to in connection with every demand at issue as is usually provided in a separate statement.➪ [8:532.13] PRACTICE POINTER: CRC 3.1345 provides that no separate statement is required when the “court has allowed the moving party to submit … a concise outline.” [CRC 3.1345(b)(2) (emphasis added)] So, before you file a motion to compel, despite Marriage of Moore, supra, it is better practice to attempt to determine if your judge generally accepts a concise outline in lieu of a separate statement, and if not, seek court permission to file one. Avoid filing a concise outline without advance permission and facing a procedural objection (see ¶ 8:1157.4).FORMS: Separate Statement of Interrogatories and Responses in Dispute, see Form 8:20, and Concise Outline of Interrogatories and Responses in Dispute, see Form 8:20.1, in Rivera, Cal.

These forms can be modified for use in moving to compel the production of documents at a deposition.[8:532.14] Reserved.(3) [8:532.15] Special rules and procedures re motions to compel ESI production: On a motion to compel production of electronically-stored information (ESI), the party objecting to or opposing the request on the ground that the requested ESI is from a source not “reasonably accessible” because of “undue burden or expense” bears the burden of demonstrating the ESI is in fact not from a reasonably accessible source because of undue burden or expense. [CCP § 2025.450(c)]Upon a “good cause” showing by the demanding party, however, the court may grant the motion to compel even if the resisting party meets this burden. But the court may also set conditions for the discovery (including allocating the discovery expense); and, in any event, even if it finds the ESI is from a reasonably accessible source, the court must limit the frequency or extent of the ESI discovery upon determining that any of four statutorily-specified conditions exist (¶ 8:692.8). [CCP § 2025.450(d)-(f)]Cross-refer: The CCP § 2025.450 provisions concerning enforcement of ESI are the mirror image of the CCP §§ 1985.8 and 2020.220 provisions concerning burdens and procedures on objection to subpoenas for production of ESI, explained in greater detail at ¶ 8:596.65 ff.; and of the CCP § 2025.420 provisions concerning ESI discovery protective orders, explained in greater detail at ¶ 8:692.5 ff.(4) Sanctions(a) [8:533] Monetary sanctions: If the motion to compel is granted and a party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), a monetary sanction must be imposed against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated unless the court determines there was “substantial justification” for the failure to comply or other circumstances make imposition of monetary sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2025.450(g)(1)](b) [8:534] Further sanctions after order compelling discovery: If the failure to appear at deposition, answer questions or produce requested materials continues after the court orders discovery, additional sanctions may be imposed against a party deponent or the party with whom the deponent is affiliated. [CCP § 2025.450(h)] (See discussion of “issue sanction,” “evidence sanction” and “terminating sanction” at ¶ 8:2175 ff.)(c) [8:534.1] “Safe harbor” against sanctions where ESI lost or destroyed due to good faith operation of computer system: Absent exceptional circumstances, sanctions may not be imposed against a party or party’s attorney for failure to provide ESI that has been lost, damaged, altered or overwritten as a result of the “routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.” [CCP §§ 2025.450(i)(1), 2025.480(l)(1)]But this provision does not alter any obligation to preserve discoverable information.

[8:620.5] Litigation privilege bars tort liabilityWhere the witness whose deposition is sought is not a party (or a “party-affiliated” witness), a subpoena must be served to compel the witness’ attendance, testimony, or production of documents. [CCP §§ 2020.010(b), 2025.280(b); see Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175 CA4th 352, 357, 95 CR3d 900, 903 (citing text)] (CCP § 1985 et seq. dealing with subpoenas generally also apply to deposition subpoenas except as modified by § 2020.010 et seq.; see CCP § 2020.030.) The clerk of the court in which the action is pending issues the deposition subpoena forms in blank, already signed and sealed. Or, attorneys may prepare and sign their own deposition subpoena forms (without the court’s seal). [CCP § 2020.210] Subject to certain geographical limitations (see ¶ 8:621 ff.), personal service of a deposition subpoena requires a person who is a resident of California to appear, testify and produce whatever documents or things are specified in the subpoena; and also to appear in any proceedings to enforce discovery. [CCP § 2020.220(c)(3)] The original subpoena and proof of service are retained by the subpoenaing party. They are not filed with the court unless relevant to a motion to compel. [CRC 3.250(a)(1)] ➪ [8:536] PRACTICE POINTER: It is risky to rely on a nonparty witness’ promise to appear voluntarily, without subpoena. If the nonparty witness fails to appear for any reason, the court may impose a monetary sanction against the party noticing the deposition to reimburse other parties for their expenses, including attorney fees, in showing up for the aborted deposition (see CCP § 2025.440(a), ¶ 8:832).This applies even as to “friendly” witnesses. You may want to explain in advance the necessity for serving the deposition subpoena; but follow up with service in any event.One caveat is where the witness lives beyond the court’s subpoena power (e.g., in another state). In such a case, you’d have to obtain a subpoena from a court where the witness resides, and this may be complex and costly (requiring filing of some sort of proceedings in the other state; see ¶ 8:636 ff.). Therefore, you may want to weigh the risk of the witness’ breaking a promise to appear voluntarily against the costs you’re likely to incur if the witness does not appear. a. [8:537] Three types of deposition subpoena: A deposition subpoena may command either:• Only the attendance and testimony of the deponent (“testimony only” subpoena);• Only the production of business records for copying (“business records” subpoena); or• The attendance and testimony of the deponent, and the production of business records, other documents, electronically-stored information, and tangible things (“records and testimony” subpoena, officially called “deposition subpoena for personal appearance and production of documents and things”; formerly called a “subpoena duces tecum”). [CCP § 2020.020(a)-(c); see Terry v. SLICO, supra, 175 CA4th at 357-358, 95 CR3d at 903 (citing text)](1) [8:538] “Testimony only” subpoena: A deposition commanding the witness to appear and testify must meet the following requirements:• It must state the time and place where the deponent is commanded to appear;• It must set forth a summary of (1) the nature of a deposition; (2) the deponent’s rights and duties; and (3) the penalties for disobedience to a deposition subpoena (see CCP § 2020.310(b));• The deposition subpoena must state if the deposition is to be video-recorded, audio-recorded, or conducted using instant digital display (see CCP § 2020.310(c)-(d)); and• If the deponent is a corporation or other entity, both a description “with reasonable particularity” of the matters on which examination is requested, and a statement of its duty to designate its “most qualified” officers or employees to testify (CCP § 2020.310(e); see ¶ 8:473).FORM: Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance (mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-015).See Form 8:3 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[8:539] While attorneys may sign and issue their own deposition subpoenas (CCP § 2020.210(a)-(b)), they must use this subpoena form. [CRC 1.31(b)](2) [8:540] “Business records” subpoena: A deposition subpoena may command only the production of business records for copying—without attendance at a deposition. [See CCP § 2020.020(b)][8:540.1] Compare—“records and testimony” subpoena: Alternatively, business records may be obtained by use of a “records and testimony” subpoena (discussed at ¶ 8:556 ff.), requiring the custodian both to produce the records and to attend and testify at a deposition. But that is a more expensive and complicated procedure (¶ 8:558).[8:540.2] Compare—CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demands to party: The “business records” subpoena procedure is designed for discovery from nonparties (CCP § 2020.020(b)). An opposing party’s records (business or otherwise) can be obtained by a CCP § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demand (¶ 8:1417 ff.). However, it is easier to obtain discovery from a nonparty using a “business records” subpoena than to obtain discovery from an opposing party under CCP § 2031.010 et seq.:— The “business records” subpoena requires production more quickly (e.g., 15 days after service or 20 days after issuance whichever is later (see ¶ 8:545), as opposed to 30 days for § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demands).— If the opposing party refuses to comply with a § 2031.010 et seq. inspection demand, the burden is on the demanding party to file a motion to compel and show “good cause” for production. No such showing is required to enforce a “business records” subpoena. Moreover, the burden is usually on the person seeking to prevent disclosure to show grounds to quash or for a protective order (see ¶ 8:597 ff.).(a) [8:540.3] “Business records” only: The Discovery Act does not define “business records,” but the term includes every kind of record maintained by every kind of business, governmental activity, profession or occupation, whether carried on for profit or not. [See Ev.C. §§ 1270, 1560(a)]As used in CCP § 2020.410 et seq. (concerning business records subpoenas), “business records” means things like journals, account books, reports and the like—i.e., an item, collection or grouping of information about a business entity (Urban Pac. Equities Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Steiner & Libo) (1997) 59 CA4th 688, 692-693, 69 CR2d 635, 638); it also includes business records in the form of electronically-stored information (see CCP § 2020.410(a)).Compare: It does not include records which are the product of its business. [Urban Pac. Equities Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Steiner & Libo), supra, 59 CA4th at 692, 69 CR2d at 638—business records subpoena could not be used to obtain copy of deposition reporter’s transcript, which is its product, not a record of its business]1) [8:540.4] Records outside California? It is unclear whether service of a “business records” subpoena on a nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located outside the state. (As noted in ¶ 8:522, parties, in contrast to nonparties, can be compelled to produce their records no matter where located.) CCP § 2020.410(c) requires that the subpoena be directed to the records “custodian” (or someone authorized to certify the records). Whether “custodian” requires actual custody of the records is unclear. If it does, serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production of business records located elsewhere.2) [8:540.5] Limitation—records “prepared by” subpoenaed business: Even where the subpoena describes the correct type of documents, it may not be enforceable where the business records sought were prepared or generated by entities other than the subpoenaed business. [See Ev.C. § 1561(a)—records custodian must attest records were “prepared by” subpoenaed business; Cooley v. Sup.Ct. (Greenstein) (2006) 140 CA4th 1039, 1041, 45 CR3d 183, 184; and ¶ 8:543, 8:550.2]3) [8:540.6] Compare—“records and testimony” subpoena (CCP § 2020.510): The result is different where a “records and testimony” subpoena is used. That procedure extends to records in control of the subpoenaed party, not merely in the party’s custody. [See CCP § 1985(a)—witness subpoenaed to attend hearing must bring “any books, documents, electronically stored information, or other things under the witness’s control” (emphasis added) (applicable to deposition subpoenas under CCP § 2020.030)]4) [8:540.7] Comment: It is unclear whether the Legislature intended this distinction between “business records” subpoenas and “records and testimony” subpoenas. But the distinction seems dictated by the language of the respective statutes. (There is no known case authority in point.)[8:541] Reserved.(b) [8:541.1] Notice to other parties required: Copies of the “business records” subpoena must be served on all other parties who have appeared in the action. In such cases, the copies of the subpoena serve as the notice of deposition. [CCP § 2025.220(b)](If the other parties want copies of the subpoenaed records, they will have to make arrangements with whoever is doing the photocopying; ¶ 8:554.)Where personal records of a “consumer” (CCP § 1985.3, ¶ 8:580 ff.) or an employee’s employment records (CCP § 1985.6, ¶ 8:596.5 ff.) are subpoenaed, the “deposition” (or records turnover) cannot take place until at least 20 days after the subpoena is “issued.” [CCP § 2025.270(c)] (Comment: This apparently assumes the subpoena will be promptly served; if service is delayed, there may not be enough time for protective orders and motions.)(c) [8:542] Content of “business records” subpoena: The statutory requirements below (¶ 8:543 ff.) are best reviewed in conjunction with the Official Form Subpoena.FORM: Deposition Subpoena for Production of Business Records (mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-010).See Form 8:4 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).While attorneys may sign and issue their own deposition subpoenas (CCP § 2020.210(a)-(b)), they must use this subpoena form. [CRC 1.31(b)]1) [8:543] Person to whom directed: The subpoena must be directed to the “custodian of records” or some other person qualified to authenticate the records. [CCP § 2020.410(c)]A nonparty’s possession of records by itself does not necessarily make the nonparty the “custodian” of those records. The subpoena must be delivered to someone able to attest to the authenticity and trustworthiness of those records (as required by Ev.C. § 1561, see ¶ 8:550.2). This is “more than simply a clerical task.” [Cooley v. Sup.Ct. (Greenstein) (2006) 140 CA4th 1039, 1045, 45 CR3d 183, 186—error to serve subpoena on District Attorney because not “custodian” of records generated by other entities]2) [8:544] Description of records: The business records to be produced must be designated either by:— “specifically describing each individual item”; or— “reasonably particularizing each category.” [CCP § 2020.410(a) (emphasis added)]a) [8:544a] Items specifically described: The subpoena must provide a “specific description” of each item. But it need not provide information obtainable only from the records themselves or from the deponent’s record system, “like a policy number or the date when a consumer interacted with the witness.” [CCP § 2020.410(b)]b) [8:544b] Form of electronically-stored information (ESI): The subpoena must specify the form in which ESI is to be produced if the subpoenaing party desires a particular form. [CCP § 2020.410(a); see ¶ 8:1445.5 ff.]c) [8:544.1] “Reasonably particularized” categories: The categories of documents to be produced must be “reasonably” particularized from the standpoint of the party on whom the demand is made. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571—CCP § 2020.410 should not usually be used to determine whether documents exist][8:544.2] A description of document categories may be held unreasonable where it bears no relationship to the manner in which the records are kept, and imposes on the subpoenaed party the burden of searching extensive files at many locations to see what it can find to fit the categories in the demand. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571]• [8:544.3] The categories of documents described in a business records subpoena were so broad that they in effect asked for everything in the custodian’s possession relating to the subject of litigation. The subpoena was unduly burdensome and unenforceable. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222-223, 61 CR2d 567, 571-572—parties could have informally conferred or used preliminary discovery to enable reasonable description of documents sought]• [8:544.4] Sanctions were justified where a subpoena served on a law firm demanded eight broad categories of documents in all forms with no time limit, including documents implicating privacy interests of other parties, and the purpose was simply an “expeditionary search” of all financial records to locate unidentified financial misconduct. [Tedesco v. White (2023) 96 CA5th 1090, 1100-1101, 314 CR3d 901, 909-910]d) [8:544.5] Improper use of “definitions” and “instructions”: An otherwise permissible description of categories in a deposition subpoena may become burdensome if combined with detailed “definitions” and “instructions” that expand and complicate the demand. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 223, 61 CR2d 567, 572—detailed “definitions” and “instructions” turned each of 32 document requests into a complicated “category” described in more than 6 pages; held “particularly obnoxious” and “grossly excessive”][8:544.6] Compare—interrogatories: No “preface” or “instruction” at all is permitted in a set of interrogatories. [CCP § 2030.060(d); see ¶ 8:967][8:544.7 - 8:544.9] Reserved.e) [8:544.10] Preliminary discovery to determine description: For documents held by parties, interrogatories may be used to determine the existence and categories of documents sought. For documents held by nonparties, however, a preliminary deposition may be required if they refuse to provide such information informally. See discussion at ¶ 8:482.2.3) [8:545] Time for compliance: The subpoena must command compliance by the custodian of records with the duties described at ¶ 8:548 ff. on a specific date—no sooner than 20 days after the subpoena’s issuance, or 15 days after service, whichever is later. [CCP § 2020.410(c)]The party serving the subpoena and the custodian may, however, agree on a different compliance date. [Ev.C. § 1560(b)(3)]a) [8:545.1] Warning where delivery to deposition officer required: A special notice must be affixed to the subpoena where delivery to a deposition officer is required, warning against early delivery of the record. See ¶ 8:549.2.4) [8:546] Special rules for § 1985.3 and § 1985.6 subpoenas: Special rules apply to subpoenas for the “personal records” of a “consumer” (CCP § 1985.3) or “employment records” of an “employee” (CCP § 1985.6).• [8:546.1] The deposition subpoena cannot be served on the records custodian until at least 5 days after copies of the subpoena and a “Notice of Privacy Rights” have been served on the “consumer” or “employee” (see ¶ 8:588 ff., 8:596.15 ff.).• [8:546.2] When served on the records custodian, the deposition subpoena must be accompanied by either a written release from the “consumer” or “employee” or proof that the person has been served with copies of the subpoena and “Notice of Privacy Rights” (see ¶ 8:593 ff., 8:596.35 ff.). [CCP § 2020.410(d)][8:546.3] Cross-refer:— CCP § 1985.3 requirements are discussed in detail at ¶ 8:580 ff.— CCP § 1985.6 requirements are discussed at ¶ 8:596.5 ff.5) [8:547] Designation of person responsible for copying—deposition officer OR subpoenaing attorney: The subpoenaing attorney may either engage a registered professional photocopier (see Bus. & Prof.C. § 22450 et seq.), or may assume responsibility for the copying. [CCP § 2020.420; Ev.C. § 1560(e)][8:547.1] Professional photocopier: In the former case, the professional photocopier must be named in the “Deposition Officer” box in the subpoena, and either item “1.a.” or “1.b.” should be checked.Limitation: The officer must not be a relative or employee of any attorney and must have no financial interest in the lawsuit. Any objection to the officer’s qualifications is waived unless raised prior to the time set for production of the documents; or as soon thereafter as could be discovered with reasonable diligence. [CCP § 2020.420][8:547.2] Subpoenaing attorney: If the subpoenaing attorney wishes to assume responsibility for the inspection and copying, the attorney may do so by leaving the “Deposition Officer” blank, and checking item “1.c.” on the Deposition Subpoena form:“1. You are ordered to produce the business records described in Item 3 as follows: … c. [X] by making the original business records described in Item 3 available for inspection at your business address by the attorney’s representative and permitting copying at your business address under reasonable conditions during normal business hours.” [8:547.3 - 8:547.4] Reserved.6) [8:547.5] No “good cause” affidavit required: A subpoena for the production of business records need not be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration showing good cause for production of the records. [CCP § 2020.410(c)](d) [8:548] Duties of custodian of records: The duties of the person served with a “business records” subpoena depend on what the subpoena requires:1) [8:549] Where custodian directed to mail copies to professional photocopier: If item “1.a.” on the “business records” subpoena form is checked, the custodian must mail to the deposition officer (professional photocopier):• A “true, legible, and durable copy” of the business records; and• An affidavit authenticating the copies and the records (see Ev.C. § 1561).These documents must be mailed in a sealed envelope, with the records enclosed in an inner envelope marked with the name and number of the lawsuit, the custodian’s name, and the date of subpoena written thereon (see Ev.C. § 1560(c)). [CCP § 2020.430(b)]a) [8:549.1] Early delivery prohibited: To allow time for protective orders and motions, the custodian “shall not” deliver the records involved before the time specified in the subpoena … unless the parties stipulate otherwise. (If “personal records … of a consumer” are involved (see ¶ 8:580 ff.), the “consumer” must join the stipulation.) [CCP § 2020.430(d)]b) [8:549.2] Special warning required: Where the subpoena requires delivery to a deposition officer, the following legend must appear in boldface type immediately following the date and time specified for production:— “Do not release the requested records to the deposition officer prior to the date and time stated above.” [CCP § 2020.430(d)]c) [8:549.3] Comment: None of this is required, however, where the subpoenaing attorney assumes responsibility for copying the records (so that no delivery to a “deposition officer” is involved); see ¶ 8:550.1. But the subpoenaing attorney must still notify all other parties by serving copies of the business records subpoena (CCP § 2025.220(b); see ¶ 8:541.1), allowing time for protective orders and motions.2) [8:550] Where custodian required to deliver copies to professional photocopier at custodian’s address: If item “1.b.” on the “business records” subpoena form is checked, the custodian may either:• Allow the deposition officer to photocopy the records at the custodian’s office; or• Allow the deposition officer to pick up at the custodian’s office photocopies prepared by the custodian upon paying for the reasonable costs thereof (see Ev.C. § 1563). [CCP § 2020.430(c)]The custodian must also furnish an affidavit authenticating the records (Ev.C. § 1561). [CCP § 2020.430(a)(2); see ¶ 8:550.2]3) [8:550.1] Where subpoenaing attorney assumes responsibility for inspection and copying: As an alternative to the procedures described above (¶ 8:550), the subpoenaing attorney may direct the custodian to make the records available for inspection and copying by the attorney or the attorney’s representative at the custodian’s business address during normal business hours. [Ev.C. § 1560(e); CCP § 2020.430(c)(1)] (If given at least 5 days’ prior notice, the custodian must designate a time period of at least 6 hours on a date certain for this purpose.)Where this method is utilized, two separate affidavits (declarations) must be obtained:a) [8:550.2] Custodian’s affidavit: The custodian must furnish an affidavit stating in substance that:• affiant is the duly authorized custodian of the records (or other qualified witness and has authority to certify the records);• the records were prepared by personnel of the business in the ordinary course of business at or near the time of the events recorded;• the records were delivered to the attorney or the attorney’s representative for copying pursuant to Ev.C. § 1560(e);• the identity of the records; and• a description of the mode of preparation of the records. [Ev.C. § 1561(a)]FORM: Declaration of Custodian of Records, see Form 8:5 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).1/ [8:550.2a] Impact of affidavit on admissibility of records at trial: See discussion at ¶ 8:555 ff.➪ [8:550.2b] PRACTICE POINTER: Consider including a cover letter to the records custodian with the subpoena, explaining the Ev.C. § 1561 requirements and the importance of completing the affidavit truthfully and accurately.b) [8:550.3] Subpoenaing attorney’s affidavit: In addition to the custodian’s affidavit, copies of the records must be accompanied by an affidavit from the subpoenaing attorney stating these are true copies of all records delivered to the subpoenaing attorney for copying. [Ev.C. § 1561(c)]FORM: Declaration of Attorney Issuing Subpoena, see Form 8:6 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(e) [8:551] Custodian’s fee and costs: The business records custodian does not have to attend a deposition and therefore is not entitled to the witness and mileage fees payable to deponents. [CCP § 2020.230(b); see ¶ 8:579]Instead, the following costs and fees are payable to the custodian:1) [8:552] If custodian furnishes copies: If the custodian furnishes copies of the subpoenaed records, the custodian is entitled to be paid the “reasonable costs” incurred. Payment may be demanded simultaneously with delivery of the records. [CCP § 2020.430(c)(2); Ev.C. § 1563(b)(2)]a) [8:552.1] “Reasonable costs”: “Reasonable costs” includes, but is not limited to, the following:— the custodian’s clerical expense in locating the records and making them available (billed at a maximum rate of $24 per hour per person, computed at $6 per quarter hour or fraction thereof);— actual costs charged by a third party for retrieving them and returning them to storage;— copying costs (computed at $.10 per page; $.20 from microfilm); and— actual postal charges. [Ev.C. § 1563(b)(1)]b) [8:552.2] Remedy for excess charges: The subpoenaing party can petition the court to recover excess charges paid to obtain such records. The court can award costs and fees against the custodian if it finds “bad faith” (and, conversely, against the subpoenaing party if the charges are found not excessive). [Ev.C. § 1563(b)(4)]2) [8:553] If custodian delivers records to attorney for copying: Where records are delivered to the subpoenaing attorney or attorney’s representative for copying at the custodian’s place of business, the custodian must be paid:• a fee not to exceed $15 “for complying with the subpoena”; plus• any sums actually paid by the custodian to a third person (e.g., storage company) for retrieval and return of records held offsite or on microfilm. [CCP § 2020.230(b); Ev.C. § 1563(b)(6)](f) [8:554] Other parties must be allowed to purchase copies: If the copies of the business records are delivered to a professional photocopier, it is that officer’s responsibility to furnish the records to the party at whose instance the deposition subpoena was served; and to all other parties who then or thereafter notify the officer that they desire to purchase a copy of those records. [CCP § 2020.440]Where (as will frequently be the case), the subpoenaing attorney has assumed responsibility for inspecting and copying the records: “It shall be the responsibility of the attorney’s representative to deliver any copy of the records as directed in the subpoena.” [Ev.C. § 1560(e)]1) [8:554.1] Comment: Unfortunately, the mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-010 subpoena provides no “directions” as to delivery of copies. Presumably, therefore, the attorney is under the same duties as the deposition officer (professional photocopier) to notify opposing parties and allow them to purchase copies upon request. [See CCP § 2020.440]2) [8:554.2] Caution—no “shortcuts”: Using a deposition subpoena to obtain business records without giving opposing counsel the required notice or allowing them to obtain copies thereof, would appear to be a “misuse” of the discovery process (CCP § 2023.010(b)). Appropriate sanctions may be imposed against the subpoenaing party and counsel.(g) [8:555] Admissibility at trial: Copies of business records obtained in accordance with this procedure may be used at trial in lieu of the originals; and the custodian’s (or attorney’s) affidavit (¶ 8:550.2 ff.) may authenticate both the records and the copies. [CCP § 2020.430(f); Ev.C. §§ 1560-1562; see People v. Blagg (1968) 267 CA2d 598, 609-610, 73 CR 93, 101]However, the records involved (whether copies or originals) are not necessarily admissible as evidence unless they qualify as “business records” under the Ev.C. § 1271 hearsay exception. This requires, among other things, that the source of information, method and time of preparation of the record “were such as to indicate its trustworthiness.” [Ev.C. § 1271(d)]➪ [8:555.1] PRACTICE POINTER: If you intend to rely on a records custodian’s affidavit for a deposition subpoena under Ev.C. § 1560 to establish admissibility at trial, make sure the custodian also attests to the manner and mode of preparation or the sources of information in the record.Cross-refer: For a detailed discussion of the admissibility of business records, see Wegner, Fairbank, Wegner, Wegner & Chernow, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civil Trials & Evidence (TRG), Ch. 8D.(3) [8:556] “Records and testimony” subpoena: The deponent may be commanded to attend and testify and to produce described business records, documents, electronically-stored information, and/or tangible things at the deposition. [CCP § 2020.510(a)]A mandatory official form subpoena is provided for this purpose. (It is not the same form used to compel personal attendance at the deposition.)FORM: Deposition Subpoena for Personal Appearance and Production of Documents and Things (mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-020).See Form 8:7 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[8:557] Compare—“business records” subpoena: Copies of business records can also be obtained by use of a “business records” subpoena (¶ 8:540). But this is available only for business records. And, it will not provide the opportunity to question the records custodian. [CCP § 2020.410(a)][8:557.1] Compare—records located outside California: A “records and testimony” subpoena apparently compels production of records under the deponent’s control; see ¶ 8:540.4.[8:557.2] Compare—subpoena duces tecum for trial: An entirely different form is used to obtain production of documents and things at trial.FORM: Civil Subpoena (Duces Tecum) for Personal Appearance and Production of Documents, Electronically Stored Information, and Things at Trial or Hearing and Declaration (mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-002).[8:558] PROCEDURE: The “records and testimony” subpoena is probably the most complicated discovery procedure. Here is a checklist of the various steps that must be taken:• Prepare subpoena. See ¶ 8:560 ff.• Serve subpoena. See ¶ 8:568 ff.• Pay witness fees. See ¶ 8:572 ff.• Serve notice of deposition (with copy of subpoena attached). See ¶ 8:565.• Additional requirements where “personal records” of a “consumer” are subpoenaed:— Serve notice of rights on consumer. See ¶ 8:589, 8:590.— Furnish custodian with proof of service. See ¶ 8:593.(a) [8:559] No “good cause” affidavit required: The Discovery Act provides that a records and testimony subpoena “need not be accompanied by an affidavit or declaration showing good cause for the production.” [CCP § 2020.510(b); see Terry v. SLICO (2009) 175 CA4th 352, 359, 95 CR3d 900, 904 (citing text)—CCP § 2020.510(b) controls over contrary provisions in CCP §§ 1985(b) and 1987.5 (requiring affidavits showing good cause for production)](b) [8:560] Prepare subpoena: Under the Discovery Act, the subpoenaing party can simply check and fill in the appropriate boxes on the mandatory Judicial Council form Deposition Subpoena (SUBP-020) (¶ 8:556).1) [8:560.1] Notice provisions: To start off with, it must include the same notice and requirements as for a “testimony only” subpoena (CCP § 2020.310, ¶ 8:538)—all of which are covered in the Judicial Council form.2) [8:561] Description of materials to be produced: The subpoena must contain either a specific description of each individual item to be produced or a “reasonably particularizing” of each category of item (see ¶ 8:561.1). And, if testing or sampling of the materials is being sought, the subpoena must so state. [CCP § 2020.510(a)(2)-(3)]Additionally, as with a “business records” subpoena (¶ 8:544b), if ESI is sought, the “records and testimony” subpoena must specify the form in which the ESI is to be produced when the subpoenaing party desires a particular form. [CCP § 2020.510(a)(4); see ¶ 8:1445.5 ff.]a) [8:561.1] “Reasonably particularizing” categories: The Discovery Act applies the same description standard to depo subpoenas as to CCP § 2031.010 et seq. demands (¶ 8:1439) and deposition notices (¶ 8:523): i.e., the records sought may either be described individually or “by reasonably particularizing each category.” [CCP § 2020.510(a)(2) (emphasis added)]The categories must be “reasonably” particularized from the standpoint of the party on whom the demand is made. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571; see discussion at ¶ 8:544.1 ff.]• [8:561.2] If the records are so extensive that a request for “all documents” on a broad and complicated subject would be improper, a subpoena describing documents by categories that bear no relationship to the manner in which the documents are kept may not meet the “reasonable particularity” standard. Such a request might require the subpoenaed party to determine (at risk of sanctions) which of its extensive records fit a demand that asks for everything in its possession relating to a specific topic. [See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571; and ¶ 8:544.2]b) [8:562] Compare—subpoena duces tecum at trial: CCP § 1985(b), still applicable to civil trial subpoenas, requires description of the “exact matters or things desired to be produced” (emphasis added). And, cases interpret this requirement literally (see Flora Crane Service, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (1965) 234 CA2d 767, 785-787, 45 CR 79, 89-90—condemning “omnibus descriptions” and “blanket” subpoenas). However, deposition subpoenas are now governed by the more flexible standard above (¶ 8:561 ff.).[8:563] Reserved.➪ [8:564] PRACTICE POINTER: Usually, it is not difficult to describe accurately the documents you are seeking: e.g., telephone records relating to a specific telephone number; medical records relating to a particular patient; correspondence relating to a specific transaction or with a specific person.However, sometimes you simply don’t know enough about what records the nonparty witness has to describe them accurately. In such cases, the solution usually is to ask the witness, or find out from other parties to the action (through interrogatories, if necessary), what records the nonparty witness is supposed to have. If the witness refuses to cooperate, it may be necessary to depose the witness in order to determine the existence of the documents and a sufficient description for a subpoena. See discussion at ¶ 8:482.2.(c) [8:565] Attach subpoena copy to notice of deposition: A copy of the subpoena (describing the materials to be produced at the deposition) must be attached to the notice of deposition. [CCP §§ 1987.5, 2025.240(c); and see ¶ 8:488](d) [8:566] Added requirements where “personal records” of “consumer” subpoenaed (CCP § 1985.3): Service of a deposition subpoena for the “personal records” of a “consumer” (CCP § 1985.3, ¶ 8:581) must be accompanied by either:— the “consumer’s” written release of the records, or— proof of service of a special notice to the “consumer” that the records are being subpoenaed. (The purpose is to give the “consumer” a chance to seek appropriate orders protecting the privacy of such records.) [CCP §§ 2020.510(c), 1985.3(e), discussed at ¶ 8:580 ff.]1) [8:567] Similar requirements for “employment records”: The same notice and proof of service requirements apply where the business records described in the subpoena are employment records pertaining to an employee. [CCP § 2020.510(d)]FORM: Notice to Consumer or Employee and Objection (mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-025).See Form 8:8 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). b. [8:568] Service of subpoena: The second step is to serve the subpoena on the deponent or records custodian. Personal service is required, not service by mail. [CCP § 2020.220(b)-(c)]Service on a business entity may be made by delivering the subpoena to any officer, director or custodian of records (or any agent or employee authorized to accept service). [CCP § 2020.220(b)(2)]Service on a law enforcement officer may be made by either serving the officer personally or delivering two copies to the officer’s immediate supervisor (or an agent designated by the supervisor to receive service). [See Gov.C. § 68097.1](1) [8:568a] Who may serve: Any person may serve a subpoena. [CCP § 1987(a)]Compare—service of process: Unlike a subpoena, a summons may be served only by a person at least 18 years old and not a party to the action. [CCP § 414.10; see ¶ 4:110]➪ [8:568b] PRACTICE POINTER: Persons under age 18 or who are parties to the action may serve a deposition subpoena. But their declarations of service and/or testimony might be given less weight if the deponent denies service.[8:568c - 8:568e] Reserved.(2) [8:568f] Service in gated communities or “covered multifamily dwellings”: Guards or other security personnel controlling access at gated communities or “covered multifamily dwellings” (i.e., apartment buildings with three or more dwellings or condominiums with four or more dwellings) must allow the following persons access for the purpose of serving a subpoena, upon proper identification: a county sheriff or marshal, licensed process servers and licensed private investigators. The same access must be provided to investigators employed by: an office of the Attorney General, a county counsel, a city attorney, a district attorney or a public defender. [CCP § 415.21; see ¶ 4:189](3) [8:568.1] Where served: If the deponent is a California resident, service may be made anywhere in the state. [CCP § 1989]However, CCP § 2025.250 sets geographic limits on where a deposition may be taken (see ¶ 8:621 ff.), the effect of which is to limit the distance persons must travel in response to the subpoena.(4) [8:568.2] When served: Where personal appearance is required (i.e., “testimony only” or “records and testimony” subpoenas), service must be effected a “reasonable time” before the deposition. [CCP § 2020.220(a)]Compare: A “business records” subpoena must be served at least 15 days before the date set for production of the records. [CCP § 2020.410(c); ¶ 8:545](a) [8:569] “Reasonable time”: The subpoena must be served “a sufficient time in advance of the deposition to provide the deponent a reasonable opportunity to locate and produce any designated business records, documents, electronically stored information, and tangible things … and … a reasonable time to travel to the place of deposition.” [CCP § 2020.220(a) (emphasis added)]➪ [8:570] PRACTICE POINTER: Although there is no fixed minimum number of days required by statute, try to serve a deposition subpoena at least 10 days before the deposition (the same length of time as required for the notice of deposition). This usually should foreclose objections and motions to quash for inadequate time to prepare and travel.(b) [8:571] Special time requirements where “personal records” of “consumer” subpoenaed (CCP § 1985.3): Special rules apply to issuance and service of subpoenas requiring production of “personal records” of a “consumer.” [CCP § 1985.3; ¶ 8:581 ff.]1) [8:571.1] Also applicable to “employment records” (CCP § 1985.6): See discussion at ¶ 8:567.[8:571.2 - 8:571.4] Reserved.(c) [8:571.5] Five days’ notice required to subpoena “journalist’s” records: Important constitutional rights are implicated when a “journalist” (i.e., a news reporter, broadcaster, publisher or editor; see CCP § 1986.1(d)) who is not a party to the action is subpoenaed to testify in discovery proceedings (or at trial). The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects investigative reporting; and the California Constitution immunizes such persons against punishment for contempt for refusing to disclose their confidential sources and unpublished information. See discussion at ¶ 8:340 ff.Accordingly, absent “circumstances that pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the criminal investigation or present an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm,” a journalist subpoenaed in a civil or criminal proceeding must be given at least five days’ notice by the party issuing the subpoena that the journalist’s appearance will be required. [CCP § 1986.1(b)(1)] (The apparent purpose is to assure an opportunity to seek a protective order.)Likewise, and subject to the same exception, a party issuing a subpoena to a third party that seeks a journalist’s records must provide at least five days’ advance notice to the journalist and the publisher or station operations manager that employs or contracts with the journalist. That notice must include, “at a minimum,” an explanation why the records being sought will be of “material assistance” to the party seeking them and why other sources of information are not sufficient to avoid the need for the subpoena. [CCP § 1986.1(b)(2)] c. [8:572] Payment of witness fees: The deposing party must pay a deponent who is required to appear for deposition the same witness fees and mileage payable to witnesses who appear in court. Such payment must be made whether or not requested by the deponent. [CCP § 2020.230][8:573] Compare—trial witnesses: Under CCP § 1987(a), fees are payable only if demanded by the witness at time of service of the subpoena. But § 2020.230(a) supersedes this as to depositions.(1) [8:574] When payment due: Payment can be made (at the option of the subpoenaing party) either at the time the subpoena is served or at the time of the deposition. [CCP §§ 2020.230, 1986.5](2) [8:575] Amount: The amount payable currently is $35 per day plus $.20 per mile to and from the place of deposition. [CCP § 2020.230(a); Gov.C. § 68093](3) [8:576] Special rules for law enforcement officers: Where a “peace officer” (police, sheriff, highway patrol, etc.) is sought to be deposed on matters investigated in the course of the officer’s official duties, the party requesting the subpoena must reimburse the public entity for the officer’s salary and travel expenses; and must tender to the person accepting the subpoena $275 for each day the officer’s presence is required. [See Gov.C. § 68097.2(b); Nick v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1993) 12 CA4th 1407, 1415, 16 CR2d 305, 309—subpoena properly refused absent tender of required fee]The court may relieve indigent parties of such payments. [Gov.C. § 68097.55](a) [8:577] Not applicable where government party to action: No such payment is required where the police officer’s employer is a party to the action (e.g., P sues City for personal injuries arising out of collision with police car). In such cases, the police officer receives the same witness fee and mileage payable to other deponents, and not the special compensation under Gov.C. § 68097.2. [Patterson v. Sharp (1967) 253 CA2d 838, 841, 61 CR 517, 519; Fox v. State Personnel Bd.

The designating party must produce such expert for deposition upon notice. [CCP § 2034.460(a), ¶ 8:1688]But the deposing party must pay an expert witness fee: i.e., the expert’s “reasonable and customary” fees for the time spent in deposition. The anticipated expert witness fee must be tendered with the deposition notice or at commencement of the deposition. [CCP §§ 2034.430(b), 2034.450(a); see ¶ 8:1697 ff.; see also True v. Shank (2000) 81 CA4th 1250, 1256, 97 CR2d 462, 466 (citing text)](5) [8:579] No witness fee or mileage on “business records” subpoena: A person served with a “business records” subpoena (¶ 8:540) is not obliged to attend a deposition; therefore, no mileage or witness fee is payable. [CCP §§ 2020.230(b), 1986.5](The custodian is entitled, however, to “reasonable costs” for furnishing copies; or a $15 fee for delivering the records to the subpoenaing attorney for copying.

[8:580] Additional requirements for subpoenaing “personal records” of “consumer” or employee: Special notice and procedures are required for production of the “personal records” of a “consumer” or employee, to protect that person’s right of privacy. The purpose is to give that person the opportunity to seek a court order to quash or limit the subpoena before the records are disclosed. [See CCP §§ 1985.3(e), 1985.6(e)]These requirements apply where production is sought from a nonparty. By contrast, personal records held by an opposing party can be obtained without subpoena by a CCP § 2031.010 inspection demand (¶ 8:1421 ff.). (However, even under CCP § 2031.010, privacy rights are protectible; see ¶ 8:293.)(1) [8:581] Records subject to requirements: The additional requirements below (¶ 8:586 ff.) apply whenever “personal records” of a “consumer” are subpoenaed from a nonparty custodian. [CCP § 1985.3]The quoted phrases have special statutory meanings:(a) [8:582] “Personal records”: This term means records or electronic data pertaining to a “consumer” (¶ 8:584) maintained either by a:• Physician;• Psychotherapist (as defined in Ev.C. § 1010);• Dentist;• Ophthalmologist or optometrist;• Chiropractor;• Physical therapist;• Acupuncturist;• Podiatrist;• Hospital, medical center, clinic, radiology or MRI center, clinical or diagnosis laboratory;• Pharmacy or pharmacist;• Attorney;• Accountant;• Bank, savings and loan association;• Credit union or member of Federal Credit System;• Securities brokerage;• Mortgage loan broker;• Escrow agent;• Private or public school or community college;• Title company or insurance company;• Trust company;• Telephone company; or• Veterinarian or veterinary hospital or clinic. [See CCP § 1985.3(a)(1)]1) [8:583] Includes records held for safekeeping: The term “personal records” includes not only the custodian’s own records pertaining to its dealings with the “consumer,” but also to documents and records held for safekeeping on behalf of the “consumer.” [Sasson v. Katash (1983) 146 CA3d 119, 124, 194 CR 46, 48—lease held by Bank in safekeeping for Landlord](b) [8:584] “Consumer”: This term means basically any noncorporate party; i.e., an individual, partnership of 5 or fewer persons, association or trust. [CCP § 1985.3(a)(2)](c) [8:585] Also applies to “personal information” in government files: The same subpoena and notice requirements below (¶ 8:586 ff.) are also required where “personal information” is subpoenaed from government files. (This applies, however, only where the “consumer” is a natural person.) [CCP § 1985.4; Board of Registered Nursing v. Sup.Ct.

[CCP § 1985.3(b)(2), (3)]Effect of time for service on records custodian: As a practical matter, this means the depo subpoena and privacy notice must be served on the consumer at least 20 days before the date set for production because the depo subpoena must be served on the records custodian at least 15 days before that date (CCP § 2020.410(c); see ¶ 8:545).[8:590.2] Reserved.a) [8:590.3] Extended for service by mail, Express Mail, fax or electronically: If the documents are served by mail (see ¶ 8:590), these time limits are extended under CCP § 1013(a); e.g., if the place of mailing and the address are both in California, they must be served at least 15 calendar days before the deposition and 10 days before service on the records custodian. [CCP § 1985.3(b)(2), (3)]The extension is only 2 court days for notices served by express mail or other method providing for overnight delivery, by fax, or by electronic transmission or notification.

The court must determine whether “good cause” and “due diligence” have been shown.4) [8:590.6] Exception—records with identifying information redacted: The notice requirements of CCP § 1985.3(b) do not apply where a records custodian is required to delete all information that would identify the consumer whose records are sought.

[CCP § 1985.3(b)(3)]Comment: Those documents will have to be served on the “consumer” at least 20 days before the date set for production in order to accommodate the time allowed for service on the records custodian (see ¶ 8:590.1).2) [8:593] Proof that consumer notified: Along with the deposition subpoena, the subpoenaing party must serve the records custodian with either:• [8:593.1] Written release: A written release of the records signed by the “consumer” or the consumer’s attorney of record. (If signed by an attorney, the custodian may presume the attorney has authority from the “consumer” and that any objection to release of the records is waived.) [CCP §§ 1985.3(c), 2020.410(d)]• [8:593.2] Proof of service: More commonly, proof of service on the “consumer” or the consumer’s attorney of record of a copy of the depo subpoena and notice of privacy rights, described above (¶ 8:590). [CCP §§ 1985.3(c), 2020.410(d)]• [8:593.3] Exception—telephone records: Proof of service is not sufficient to obtain telephone company records pertaining to a customer.

(2014) 230 CA4th 35, 43-45, 178 CR3d 10, 16-17—producing party should have agreed to reimbursement for costs of extracting data into reasonably usable electronic format]➪ [8:596.53] PRACTICE POINTERS—DRAFTING SUBPOENAS FOR ESI: See the Practice Pointer at ¶ 8:1445.6 re drafting CCP § 2031.010 demands.(3) [8:596.54] Where subpoena does not specify form for production: If the subpoena does not specify a form for producing the ESI, it must be produced in the form “in which it is ordinarily maintained” or in a form “that is reasonably usable,” unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise. [CCP §§ 1985.8(d)(1), 2020.220(d)(1)](4) [8:596.55] Same information need not be produced in more than one form: The same ESI need not be produced in more than one form unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise.

This includes situations where the subpoena requires production of ESI in a different form than that in which it is regularly maintained; or where the data is maintained in a form not reasonably usable by the subpoenaed party.(6) [8:596.62] Where ESI password protected: A deponent producing ESI must provide access to any ESI that is password protected. [CCP § 2025.280(c)][8:596.63 - 8:596.64] Reserved.(7) [8:596.65] Opposing production where ESI not reasonably accessible: A subpoenaed person may oppose the production and move to quash the subpoena on the ground that the ESI sought is not reasonably accessible because of “undue burden or expense.” [CCP §§ 1985.8(e), 1987.1, 2020.220(e)]The objection preserves other objections to the production of ESI (see ¶ 8:1475.12).(a) [8:596.66] Burden shifting on motion to quash: The person opposing production has the burden of initially proving the ESI comes from a source that is not “reasonably accessible because of undue burden or expense.” [CCP §§ 1985.8(e), 2020.220(e); see Vasquez v. California School of Culinary Arts, Inc. (2014) 230 CA4th 35, 42, 178 CR3d 10, 15]If such a showing is made, the burden shifts to the subpoenaing party to show “good cause” for production notwithstanding the burden or expense. [CCP §§ 1985.8(f), 2020.220(f)](8) [8:596.67] Order for production may be conditional: If it finds “good cause” for production of the ESI, the court may set conditions on its production, including allocating the expenses incurred. [CCP §§ 1985.8(g), 2020.220(g); see further discussion at ¶ 8:1456.27]Costs required to convert data files from a source that is not reasonably accessible may be approved in the court’s discretion as a recoverable cost.

[CCP §§ 1985.8(i), 2020.220(i)](a) [8:596.72] Effect: The burden is on the party resisting discovery to establish with admissible evidence one or more of these grounds. Each calls for a case-by-case determination within the sound discretion of the trial court.[8:596.73 - 8:596.74] Reserved.(11) [8:596.75] “Clawback” procedures for disclosure of privileged information: A special procedure is provided to resolve claims that documents produced in response to a subpoena for ESI are privileged or work product and should be returned. CCP §§ 1985.8(j) and 2020.220(j) incorporate the “clawback” procedure provided in CCP § 2031.285 for such cases (see ¶ 8:1481.5 ff.).(12) [8:596.76] “Safe harbor” against sanctions where ESI lost or destroyed due to good faith operation of computer system: Absent exceptional circumstances, sanctions may not be imposed on a person responding to a subpoena (or on that person’s attorney) for failure to provide ESI that has been lost, damaged, altered or overwritten as a result of the “routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.” [CCP §§ 1985.8(m)(1), 1987.2(b)(1), 2020.220(m)(1), 2023.030(f)(1), 2025.410(e)(1), 2025.450(i)(1) (emphasis added)]But this “safe harbor” does not alter any obligation to preserve discoverable information. [CCP §§ 1985.8(m)(2), 1987.2(b)(2), 2020.220(m)(2), 2023.030(f)(2), 2025.410(e)(2), 2025.450(i)(2)]Only “good faith operation” is protected under the statute, so if a party allows data to be destroyed knowing that materials relevant to the litigation may be lost, that party may not invoke the safe harbor. g. [8:597] Procedures for challenging deposition subpoena: Either the nonparty witness who has been subpoenaed, or any party to the action, may challenge the deposition subpoena.➪ [8:597.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Consider alternative procedures discussed at ¶ 8:787.1.(1) [8:598] Grounds: A deposition subpoena may be attacked for:• Defects in form or content of the subpoena (e.g., inadequate description of requested documents in “records only” or “records and testimony” subpoenas);• Defects in service of the subpoena, including tender of fees;• Records sought not within permissible scope of discovery—i.e., privileged, privacy or attorney work product; or not “relevant to the subject matter”;• Unjustly burdensome or oppressive demands;• With regard to requested ESI discovery, objection to the specified form for producing the ESI (CCP § 1985.8(c), ¶ 8:596.52a) or objection to production on the ground that the ESI is from a source that is not reasonably accessible because of undue burden and expense (CCP § 1985.8(e), ¶ 8:596.65 ff.);• “Consumer’s” right of privacy in “personal records” (CCP § 1985.3(e), ¶ 8:580 ff.); or• Employee’s right of privacy in “employment records” (CCP § 1985.6(e), ¶ 8:596.5 ff.).[8:599] Reserved.(2) [8:600] Particular procedures: The procedures that may be used depend on who is raising the challenge:(a) [8:601] Motion to quash deposition subpoena duces tecum: A motion to quash (or modify) a deposition subpoena for production of documents may be made by:— a party;— a (nonparty) witness;— a “consumer” whose personal records have been subpoenaed (CCP § 1985.3, see ¶ 8:580 ff.);— an “employee” whose “employment records” have been subpoenaed (CCP § 1985.6, see ¶ 8:596.5 ff.); or— a person whose “personally identifying information” (see Civ.C. § 1798.79.8) is sought in connection with an action involving the exercise of free speech rights (e.g., a defamation action based on anonymous Internet postings). [CCP § 1987.1(b)]1) [8:602] Service requirements: A motion to quash by a “consumer” or “employee” must be served on the witness and the deposition officer at least five days before the date set for production of the subpoenaed records. (Failure to serve the deposition officer does not invalidate the motion but excuses the officer from liability for improper release of the subpoenaed records.) [CCP §§ 1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)]a) [8:602.1] Time limit not jurisdictional: The five-day time limit for service is not jurisdictional. The court can grant a motion to quash served even after the date set for production. [Slagle v. Sup.Ct. (Maryon) (1989) 211 CA3d 1309, 1313, 260 CR 122, 124][8:602.2 - 8:602.4] Reserved.2) [8:602.5] Separate statement of disputed matters required: A motion to quash production of documents at a deposition must be accompanied by a separate statement setting forth the particular documents or demands at issue and the factual and legal reasons why production should not be compelled.

[CCP § 1987.1(c)]Instead, that person may serve the subpoenaing party, the records custodian and the deposition officer with written objections to production of the subpoenaed records, stating specific grounds on which production of the records should be prohibited (e.g., invasion of privacy). [CCP §§ 1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(2); Thai v. Richmond City Center, L.P. (2022) 86 CA5th 282, 287, 302 CR3d 356, 358-359][8:603.1 - 8:603.4] Reserved.1) [8:603.5] Production of records automatically stayed: Either filing a motion to quash or serving such written objections (by a nonparty “consumer” or “employee”) automatically excuses the custodian and deposition officer from producing the subpoenaed records until the court orders their production or the parties stipulate to the production. [CCP §§ 1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(3); Thai v. Richmond City Center, L.P. (2022) 86 CA5th 282, 287, 302 CR3d 356, 359]2) [8:604] Motion to enforce subpoena over written objections: Where a nonparty “consumer” or “employee” has served written objections as stated above (¶ 8:603), the requesting party may move for an order to enforce the subpoena. (The burden of obtaining a court order is on the party seeking discovery.) [CCP §§ 1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(4)]a) [8:604.1] Filing and service requirements: Any such motion must be filed within 20 days after service of the written objections.

[CCP §§ 1985.3(g), 1985.6(f)(4)](c) [8:605] Protective orders: Alternatively, any party, witness, consumer, employee or person whose personal identifying information is sought in connection with an action involving that person’s right of free speech (see ¶ 8:601) may seek a protective order against the subpoena or deposition proceedings. The court may make whatever orders are appropriate to protect that person from “unreasonable or oppressive demands, including unreasonable violations of the right of privacy of the person.” [CCP § 1987.1 (emphasis added); see CCP § 2025.420(b), ¶ 8:675 ff.](d) [8:605.1] Objections to “records only” subpoena: A nonparty served with a “records only” subpoena may either move to quash all or a portion of the subpoena, or merely object to the production of all or some of the documents and put the onus on the proponent to make a motion to compel.

But your objection by itself will not prevent the nonparty witness from testifying. Thus, the information you are trying to protect will be disclosed notwithstanding the validity of your objection. (The testimony may be inadmissible at trial but that is usually not the point of the objection.) h. [8:609] Enforcing subpoena: Personal service of a deposition subpoena obligates any resident of California to appear, testify and produce whatever documents or things are specified in the subpoena; and to appear in any proceedings to enforce discovery. [CCP § 2020.220(c)]The deposition subpoena is enforceable either by:• A motion to compel compliance (CCP § 1987.1);• Contempt proceedings (¶ 8:610); and/or• A civil damages action by the aggrieved party (¶ 8:618). [CCP § 2020.240](1) [8:609.1] Motion to compel: If a nonparty disobeys a depo subpoena, the subpoenaing party may seek a court order compelling the nonparty to comply with the subpoena within 60 days after completion of the deposition record.

Bader (2007) 156 CA4th 123, 127, 67 CR3d 111, 112]The deposition record is “complete” as of the “date specified for production” or the date objections are served.

Although attorney fees may be awarded in contempt proceedings (see ¶ 8:617), such an award is more likely in connection with a motion to compel under CCP § 1987.2.Also, contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature and require extensive procedural safeguards (¶ 8:612 ff.), and almost never result in actual adjudications of contempt. Therefore, many courts discourage OSCs re Contempt and prefer issuing OSCs re an Order to Comply.(a) [8:609.3] Document discovery “good cause” requirement: A showing of “good cause” is required on motions to compel document discovery from a party under CCP § 2025.450(b)(1) (depositions) or § 2031.310(b)(1) (inspection demands). But the relevant statutes do not specify such requirement on a motion to compel a nonparty to comply with a deposition subpoena for document production (see CCP §§ 1987.1, 2025.480). At least one court has held that if there is a “good cause” showing required to compel production of party documents, such a requirement also applies to nonparty production. [Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 223-224, 61 CR2d 567, 572—“since it is unlikely the Legislature intended to place greater burdens on a nonparty than on a party to the litigation, we read a similar [good faith] requirement” into the relevant statutes](b) [8:609.4] Special rules re motion to compel production of electronically-stored information: See discussion at ¶ 8:532.15.(2) [8:610] Contempt: A deponent who disobeys a deposition subpoena may be punished for contempt—without the necessity of a prior court order directing compliance by the witness or any showing of good cause. [CCP §§ 1209(a)(10), 1991.1, 2020.240, 2023.030(e)](If necessary, the court may issue a civil bench warrant for the deponent’s arrest; CCP §§ 1993-1993.2.)(a) [8:611] “Disobedience”: “Disobedience” means a conscious refusal to attend the deposition. It must be shown that the witness had knowledge of the subpoena, the ability to comply with it, and deliberately failed to do so. If the failure was inadvertent, ordinarily no remedy of any kind is available against the witness. [See CCP § 1991; and Chapman v. Sup.Ct. (1968) 261 CA2d 194, 200, 67 CR 842, 846](b) Procedural matters• [8:612] The subpoenaing party must file an affidavit alleging proper service of the subpoena on the witness and the witness’ “disobedience” (i.e., willful refusal to appear or testify, etc.).• [8:613] The court will then issue an order to show cause (OSC) re contempt. The OSC and affidavit must be served personally on the witness. [Cedars-Sinai Imaging Med. Group v. Sup.Ct. (Moore) (2000) 83 CA4th 1281, 1286-1287, 100 CR2d 320, 324](Thus, a stubborn witness has to be personally served twice—once with the deposition subpoena, and then again with the OSC re contempt.)• [8:614] The hearing on the OSC is normally before the law and motion judge or department; or, where an “all purpose” or “direct calendar” assignment has been made, to the assigned judge.(Comment: The judge will most likely order the witness to appear for and submit to the taking of the witness’ deposition, and hold the contempt proceedings in abeyance pending compliance. Judges are usually more interested in compliance than in inflicting punishment.)• [8:615] An order finding the witness guilty of contempt must recite the specific facts giving rise to the contempt (including the ability to perform). Without such facts, the order is void. [In re de la Parra (1986) 184 CA3d 139, 144, 228 CR 864, 867](c) [8:616] Punishment: A person found guilty of contempt is subject to fine (up to $1,000) or imprisonment (up to 5 days), or both. [CCP § 1218; see People v. Gonzalez (1996) 12 C4th 804, 816, 50 CR2d 74, 82]A court could also impose civil contempt sanctions: i.e., imprisonment until the party complies (or as a practical matter, agrees to comply). [CCP § 1219(a)](d) [8:617] Attorney fees: In addition, a party or “an agent” of a party to the action who is adjudged guilty of contempt may be ordered to pay the opposing party’s reasonable attorney fees in connection with the contempt proceedings. [See CCP § 1218(a)]➪ [8:617.1] PRACTICE POINTER: The contempt procedure is complex, time-consuming and doomed to failure unless all the procedural niceties are observed. Even if they are met, many judges are reluctant to hold a person in contempt absent a prior court order.Therefore, it is usually a better idea to move first for an order compelling the deponent to attend and for an award of monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:617.5). Consider contempt proceedings only if the witness disobeys a specific court order or otherwise is persistently recalcitrant.[8:617.2 - 8:617.4] Reserved.(3) [8:617.5] Monetary sanctions: Monetary sanctions (as well as contempt) are available against nonparties who “flout the discovery process.” [Temple Comm.

Thereafter, no contempt or forfeiture proceedings lie even if the witness refuses to answer any and all questions. The deposing party’s remedy is to obtain a court order directing the witness to answer (CCP § 2025.480(a); see ¶ 8:787 ff.).

[8:818] Sanctions for disobedience to order to compelIf a deponent fails to answer a deposition question or produce documents or things designated in the deposition notice or subpoena, the examiner may either complete the examination on other matters or adjourn the deposition. [CCP §§ 2025.460(e), 2025.480(a); see ¶ 8:737] In either event, if the examiner wants an answer to the question or the documents produced, the examiner must file a motion to compel within the time limit and in accordance with the procedures discussed below (¶ 8:788 ff.). [CCP § 2025.480(b)-(k)] a. [8:787.1] Consider informal conference as alternative to discovery motions: Many judges try to avoid formal discovery motions. Although counsel are required to try to resolve discovery disputes informally before filing motion papers (see ¶ 8:811, 8:1158 ff.), this is often unsuccessful.To avoid the costs and delay of formal discovery motions, many civil judges with individual calendars are available for an informal conference. Each judge has established procedures for that judge’s courtroom. In addition, any party can request an informal discovery conference. Although a statutory procedure for informal discovery conferences (CCP § 2016.080) was repealed effective 1/1/23, the judge still may be willing to hear discovery matters informally and may order such an informal conference on a case-by-case basis.In preparation for the conference, unless otherwise ordered by the court, it is helpful for counsel to submit a short (e.g., a single page) description of the discovery dispute. The judge then meets with counsel and tries to resolve the dispute, often with a suggestion of how the court might rule if presented with a motion. For most discovery disputes, such guidance from the court is all that is necessary. (For some disputes, however (e.g., those with complicated privilege issues), counsel will want to make a motion and obtain a formal ruling to preserve the issue for appellate review.)Counsel should consider asking the court for such an informal conference before incurring substantial costs. The judge will probably appreciate counsel’s efforts to save costs and avoid delay, and the time saved for the court in reviewing and ruling on a formal discovery motion. b. [8:788] Alternative procedures to set court hearing: The examiner has several alternatives in noticing a motion to compel answers to deposition questions:• State the time and date of the motion hearing at the time of the deposition; or• Obtain and serve an order to show cause (OSC) on the witness after the deposition; or• Simply serve and file a regular notice of motion for the order sought.(1) [8:789] Oral notice at deposition: Any time before the end of the deposition, the examiner may notify the deponent and other parties present when and where the motion to compel will be heard (the motion must be “made” within 60 days after completion of transcript; see ¶ 8:801). The deposition officer must then direct the deponent to appear in court at the time and place specified. [CCP § 2025.480(c)]Note that the examining counsel does not order the witness to appear personally. Counsel merely states on the record when and where the motion to compel will be heard. It is the deposition officer who must then direct the deponent (i.e., instruct the deponent to appear at the time and place specified). [See Parker v. Wolters Kluwer U.S., Inc. (2007) 149 CA4th 285, 296, 57 CR3d 18, 26, fn. 24](a) [8:790] Written notice required for nonparty deponents: Although the Discovery Act allows oral notice at the time of the deposition, court rules require personal service of written notice of motion to compel answers by a deponent who is not a party to the action, “unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on the deposition record.” [CRC 3.1346]1) [8:791] Comment: This does not foreclose the oral notice procedure at the deposition; but simply requires a “follow up” written notice as well. (As discussed below, the moving papers must be personally served on the nonparty deponents; ¶ 8:797.)(b) [8:792] Written notice to other parties: Although oral notice may be sufficient for party-deponents, a written notice of motion must be served on all other parties to the action even if they were present at the deposition. [See CCP § 2025.480(c)]➪ [8:793] PRACTICE POINTER: Before giving oral notice to the witness, make sure of two things:• When transcript will be completed: Ask the deposition reporter to estimate how long it will take to complete the deposition transcript, because the hearing date must be within 60 days thereafter (see ¶ 8:801). Also, you will need to lodge relevant parts of the transcript, or a joint statement in lieu thereof, with the court before the hearing (see ¶ 8:802 ff.).• Availability of date chosen: It’s a good idea to take a short recess in the deposition and call the clerk in the department where the motion will be heard to check on availability of the date. Or, for those courts that require motion dates to be scheduled online, try to determine the date electronically.[8:794 - 8:795] Reserved.(2) [8:796] Mailed notice: Another alternative is for the examiner simply to serve and file a regular notice of motion for the order sought. Such notice can be served on the deponent personally, by mail or any other authorized method of service under the statutes governing service of notice generally (CCP § 1010 et seq.). Copies must likewise be served on all other parties to the action. [CCP § 2025.480(c)]Cross-refer: The motion is governed by the rules and procedures governing motions generally; see Ch. 9 Part I.(a) [8:797] Limitation—personal service required for nonparty deponents: Court rules require that the notice of motion to compel answers and all supporting papers be personally served on nonparty deponents. Service by mail alone is not sufficient, “unless the nonparty deponent agrees to accept service by mail or electronic service at an address or electronic service address specified on the deposition record.” [CRC 3.1346] c. [8:798] Motion filed in court where action pending: Even if the deposition was taken in another county (e.g., where deponent resides), the motion is heard in the court where the action is pending. [CCP § 2025.480(c)] d. [8:799] Jurisdiction over nonparty deponents: Party-deponents, of course, are already subject to the personal jurisdiction of the court where the action is pending (see Chapter 3). Nonparty deponents “subjected themselves to court jurisdiction” by appearing at the deposition and refusing to answer questions. [Marriage of Lemen (1980) 113 CA3d 769, 780, 170 CR 642, 647 (upholding award of sanctions against nonparty deponent and his lawyer based on mailed notice of motion)]Moreover, service of a deposition subpoena on a California resident notifies the nonparty deponent that failure to appear is punishable as a contempt of court. [See mandatory Judicial Council form SUBP-015, Form 8:3 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG)](1) [8:800] Compare—out-of-state depo: However, where a nonparty witness’ deposition is taken out-of-state, any motion to compel must be brought where the deposition is taken; see ¶ 8:636 ff. e. [8:801] Time limit on motion: The motion to compel must be “made no later than 60 days after the completion of the record of the deposition.” [CCP § 2025.480(b) (emphasis added)]Notice of motion and all supporting papers must be filed within the mandatory 60-day period. [Weinstein v. Blumberg (2018) 25 CA5th 316, 321, 235 CR3d 658, 662—service of “notice of motion and motion to compel” within 60-day period, but memorandum of points and authorities, separate statement and declarations served later rendered motion untimely]Comment: It is unclear whether the deposition record is “completed” when the reporter sends notice that the transcript is available for review (see ¶ 8:769) or only after the expiration of time to sign or correct the transcript (see ¶ 8:770.3). The safer course is to use the date of the reporter’s notice. (Compare: The date when a third party deposition for documents is “complete” is discussed at ¶ 8:609.1.)(1) [8:801.1] Compare—no time limit on motion for party’s failure to appear or produce documents: CCP § 2025.450 contains no time limit for a motion to compel where a party fails to attend the deposition or produce any documents after valid service of the deposition notice and no objections have been made. f. [8:801.2] Showing of “good cause” required for document production: A motion to compel production of documents described in a deposition notice must be accompanied by a showing of “good cause”—i.e., declarations containing specific facts justifying inspection of the documents described in the notice. [CCP § 2025.450(b)(1)](1) [8:801.3] Liberally construed: “Good cause” has been construed liberally in the past: Justification for discovery is found where specific facts show the documents are necessary for effective trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial. [Associated Brewers Dist. Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.) (1967) 65 C2d 583, 587, 55 CR 772, 775]The fact that there is no alternative source for the information sought is an important factor in establishing “good cause.” But it is not essential. [Associated Brewers Dist. Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.), supra, 65 C2d at 587-588, 55 CR at 775-776] g. [8:802] Transcript must be “lodged” with court: The moving party must “lodge” with the court, at least 5 days before the hearing on the motion, a certified copy of whatever parts of the transcript are relevant to the motion. [CCP § 2025.480(h)]➪ [8:803] PRACTICE POINTER: Consult with your judge; most dispense with this requirement unless there is an issue of the accuracy of the copies used.[8:804] Reserved.(1) [8:805] Certified copy: The statute requires a “certified copy” of “any parts” of the transcript lodged. [CCP § 2025.480(h)](2) [8:806] Deposit and return of transcript: The deposition transcript is merely deposited with the clerk of the court in which the motion is to be heard (not the main court clerk’s office). It will be returned to the party that deposited it after the hearing, unless the court orders otherwise.➪ [8:806.1] PRACTICE POINTER: To facilitate return of the transcript, attach a stamped self-addressed envelope to the “lodged” transcript.“Lodging” of documents with the court is discussed at ¶ 9:51 ff.(3) [8:807] No use of “rough draft” transcript: A “rough draft” transcript cannot be certified, nor used as a certified transcript or to rebut or contradict a certified transcript. [CCP § 2025.540(b)] h. [8:808] Moving papers: The motion to compel should comply with the same CRC 3.1345 format/content requirements discussed in connection with motions to compel further answers to interrogatories. See discussion at ¶ 8:1151 ff.FORM: Motion for Order Compelling Answers to Deposition Questions (and Production of Documents and for Sanctions) and Proposed Order, see Form 8:12 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [8:809] Separate statement of matters in dispute required: The questions and answers in dispute must be set forth verbatim in a separate document (not in the notice of motion itself). This separate document must also state the factual or legal reasons why a further answer should be compelled. Alternatively, the court may permit the use of a “concise outline” of the issues. [CRC 3.1345(a), (b)(2), (c); see discussion at ¶ 8:532.12 ff., 8:1151 ff.]• FORM: Separate Statement of Disputed Questions and Answers, see Form 8:13 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(2) [8:810] Declaration supporting motion: A declaration is also required, showing a good faith attempt to resolve the dispute informally (¶ 8:811), reasonable expenses incurred as ground for sanctions (¶ 8:835.2) and, if documents are involved, “good cause” for their production (¶ 8:801.2 ff., 8:1495 ff.). (See Form 8:12 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).) i. [8:811] Attempt to resolve informally (“meet and confer”) requirement: The motion to compel must be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt at an informal resolution of each issue presented by the motion.” [CCP §§ 2016.040 (emphasis added), 2025.480(b); see detailed discussion at ¶ 8:1158 ff. in connection with motions to compel further answers to interrogatories](1) [8:812] Postdeposition efforts required? The statute requires a serious effort at negotiation and informal resolution; i.e., counsel must “attempt to talk the matter over, compare their views, consult, and deliberate.” [Townsend v. Sup.Ct. (EMC Mortg. Co.) (1998) 61 CA4th 1431, 1433, 72 CR2d 333, 334—informal resolution requirement not fulfilled by bickering between counsel during deposition]This is not always possible in the heat of a deposition; a brief cooling-off period may be necessary. But there is no absolute rule requiring that informal resolution always await conclusion of the deposition: “We leave it to the parties to determine the proper time, manner, and place for such discussion.” [Townsend v. Sup.Ct. (EMC Mortg. Co.), supra, 61 CA4th at 1438, 72 CR2d at 337 (citing text); see Obregon v. Sup.Ct. (Cimm’s, Inc.) (1998) 67 CA4th 424, 431, 79 CR2d 62, 66, fn. 8; Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 CA4th 1006, 1016, 105 CR2d 115, 122—good faith effort shown by off-the-record discussions at deposition where issue was relatively simple and no other opportunity to confer before discovery cut-off date; Safechuck v. MJJ Productions, Inc. (2023) 94 CA5th 675, 699-700, 312 CR3d 452, 471-472—sanctions imposed where counsel did not meet and confer either during or after deposition and only sent “ultimatum” letter demanding agreement](2) [8:813] Compare—where deponent fails to appear or produce records: No “meet and confer” is required where the deponent “fails to attend the deposition and produce the documents … described in the deposition notice.” In such cases, all that is required is a declaration by the moving party that the party has contacted the deponent “to inquire about the nonappearance.” [CCP § 2025.450(b)(2)](a) [8:813.1] Failure to appear alone: Although the statute appears to apply only if the deponent fails to both appear and produce documents, it has been held to apply simply on a deponent’s failure to appear. [Leko v. Cornerstone Building Inspection Service (2001) 86 CA4th 1109, 1124, 103 CR2d 858, 869](b) [8:813.2] Good-faith inquiry required: Implicit in the requirement that counsel contact the deponent to “inquire” about the nonappearance is a requirement that counsel listen to the reasons offered and make a good faith attempt to resolve the issue by rescheduling the deposition. [Leko v. Cornerstone Building Inspection Service, supra, 86 CA4th at 1124, 103 CR2d at 869—failure to consider rescheduling depo and instead filing motion to compel resulted in sanctions against deposing counsel for filing unnecessary motion]➪ [8:813.3] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid slip-ups, it is always a good idea for deposing counsel to contact deponent’s counsel the day before a scheduled deposition to make sure the deponent plans to appear. Doing so strengthens a motion for sanctions in event of nonappearance. (But it is still necessary to file a declaration that you contacted deponent’s counsel to “inquire” about the nonappearance.) j. [8:814] Burden on DEPONENT to justify refusal: A deponent who has objected to a question and refused to answer bears the burden of justifying such refusal on the motion to compel. For example, if the objection was that the question called for privileged information, the burden is on the deponent to show that the question in fact calls for information protected by a privilege.(1) [8:815] Factual matters: Sometimes, the deponent will have to prove extrinsic facts in order to justify an objection. For example, if the objection is privilege, the deponent may have to show the existence of the privileged relationship (attorney-client, spouses, etc.). [San Diego Professional Ass’n v. Sup.Ct. (Paderewski, Mitchell, Dean & Assocs.) (1962) 58 C2d 194, 199, 23 CR 384, 386]➪ [8:816] PRACTICE POINTER: Include in your moving papers arguments as to why the deponent should be ordered to answer; e.g., why the information sought is not privileged, etc. This will inform the court as to the nature of the controversy before the hearing. And, it won’t change the rule that the ultimate burden of justifying the refusal is on the objector. k. [8:817] Monetary sanction against losing party on motion to compel: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party unless it finds the losing party “acted with substantial justification” or other circumstances make imposition of the sanction “unjust.” [CCP §§ 2025.450(g)(1), 2025.480(j); but see also ¶ 8:534.1 (limitation against losing party sanctions for failure to produce ESI that has been lost, damaged, altered or overwritten as a result of the “routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system”)]The “substantial justification” standard is discussed at ¶ 8:1964 ff. (Monetary sanctions on discovery motions are discussed at ¶ 8:1921 ff.)(1) [8:817.1] Expenses and fees: The losing party may be ordered to pay the reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, incurred by the party prevailing on the motion. [CCP § 2023.030(a)] l. [8:818] Sanctions for disobedience to order to compel: If the motion to compel is granted and the court orders the deponent to answer, further sanctions may be imposed if the deponent fails to obey the court’s order:• If the deponent is a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director, managing agent or employee of party), “issue,” “evidence” or “terminating” sanctions may be imposed against the party involved. In addition or in lieu thereof, monetary sanctions may be imposed against the deponent. [CCP § 2023.030(a)-(d)]• Alternatively, the deponent (whether or not a party to the action) may be punished for contempt of court.

[8:852] Sanctions for disobeying discovery ordersVarious sanctions may be imposed to enforce discovery by deposition: a. [8:820] Sanctions for deponent’s failure to appear: The following remedies and sanctions are available where a deponent fails to attend a deposition; or appears and refuses to be sworn as a witness. (Compare: Once testimony begins, sanctions for failure to answer questions are awardable only in connection with a motion to compel; see ¶ 8:835 ff.)(1) [8:821] Nonparty witness fails to appear: A witness who is not a party to the action but has been subpoenaed to appear for deposition, is subject to the following sanctions for failure to appear or refusal to be sworn:• [8:822] Contempt proceedings for disobedience to the subpoena. (The subpoena itself is technically a court order; no other court order directing compliance is necessary.) [CCP §§ 2020.240, 1991.1; Lund v. Sup.Ct. (1964) 61 C2d 698, 713, 39 CR 891, 901; see ¶ 8:610 ff.]• [8:823] Payment of $500 to the aggrieved party, plus all damages resulting from the failure to appear. [CCP §§ 2020.240, 1992; see ¶ 8:618]• [8:823.1] Compare: Alternatively, an order compelling compliance may be granted under CCP § 1987.1 (¶ 8:609.1). The court can award expenses and fees to the prevailing party only if it finds the motion was made or opposed in “bad faith” or “without substantial justification,” or if one or more of the subpoena requirements was “oppressive.” [CCP § 1987.2][8:824] Compare—if no subpoena served: If the nonparty witness was not subpoenaed no sanctions of any kind are available against the nonparty witness for failure to appear. (However, the party noticing the deposition may be ordered to pay reasonable expenses and attorney fees incurred by other parties who showed up for the deposition expecting the witness to appear; see CCP § 2025.440(a), ¶ 8:832.)(2) [8:825] Party or person “affiliated” with party fails to appear: Service of a proper deposition notice obligates a party or “party-affiliated” witness (officer, director, managing agent or employee of party) to attend and testify, without necessity of subpoena. [CCP § 2025.280(a), ¶ 8:516 ff.]If such party or “party-affiliated” deponent fails to appear (or to produce materials designated in the deposition notice), monetary sanctions may be imposed. [CCP §§ 2025.450(g)(1), 2025.480(j); but see also ¶ 8:534.1 (limitation against sanctions for failure to produce ESI “that has been lost, damaged, altered, or overwritten as the result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system”)](a) [8:826] Who may obtain sanction: Both the party noticing the deposition and all other parties who showed up in expectation the deponent’s testimony would be taken may obtain monetary sanctions. [CCP § 2025.450(g)(1), (2)]1) [8:826.1] Lawyers appearing pro bono: Monetary sanctions in the form of fees for the reasonable value of counsel’s services may be awarded even where counsel is serving free of charge. The party entitled to the award need not have incurred a fee obligation. [See Do v. Sup.Ct. (Nguyen) (2003) 109 CA4th 1210, 1218, 135 CR2d 855, 860-861 (decided under former statute)][8:826.2 - 8:826.4] Reserved.(b) [8:826.5] Against whom sanctions may be imposed: Sanctions may be imposed against the deponent or the party with whom the deponent is “affiliated” (as an officer, director, managing agent or employee). [CCP § 2025.450(g)(1); see ¶ 8:836](c) [8:827] Failure to appear need not be willful: Monetary sanctions may be imposed against a deponent party even if the party deponent’s failure to appear was entirely inadvertent. It is enough that the deponent “fails to appear for examination.” [CCP § 2025.450(a)][8:828 - 8:829] Reserved.(d) [8:830] Discretion to refuse sanction limited: See discussion at ¶ 8:845.[8:831] Reserved. b. [8:832] Sanctions against party noticing deposition for failure to proceed: If the party noticing the deposition fails to attend or proceed with it, the court may impose a monetary sanction in favor of “any party attending in person or by attorney.” [CCP § 2025.430]Likewise, monetary sanctions can be imposed against the party noticing the deposition where a nonparty deponent fails to appear if no deposition subpoena has been served (as required by CCP § 2020.010(b)). Such sanctions can be imposed in favor of any other party who showed up for the deposition. [CCP § 2025.440(a); see ¶ 8:536](1) [8:833] Compare—no sanctions to nonparty deponents who appear: A nonparty deponent subpoenaed to attend a deposition is entitled to a witness fee and mileage (¶ 8:572). But the deponent cannot obtain monetary sanctions (e.g., attorney fees) against the party noticing the deposition for failing to proceed with it. [See Poe v. Diamond (1987) 191 CA3d 1394, 1399, 237 CR 80, 83—construing similar provision under former law][8:834] Reserved. c. [8:835] Sanctions for refusal to answer: If a deponent appears and is sworn as a witness, but thereafter refuses to answer any questions or to produce documents designated in the deposition notice or subpoena, the deposing party’s remedy is a motion to compel (see ¶ 8:620). Monetary sanctions may be awarded on the motion to compel as follows:(1) [8:835.1] Monetary sanction only: The only sanction authorized on a motion to compel, when there has been no prior court order to answer, is a monetary sanction pursuant to CCP § 2023.030(a). [CCP § 2025.480(j)](a) [8:835.2] “Reasonable expenses”: Section 2023.030(a) authorizes an order for payment of the “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees” incurred as a result of the conduct for which the sanctions are imposed. [CCP § 2023.030(a) (emphasis added)]1) [8:835.2a] Lawyers appearing pro se?: Lawyers appearing on their own behalf cannot recover attorney fees as discovery sanctions. But they can recover reasonably identifiable costs (e.g., computer-assisted legal research, or photocopying, or transportation to and from court) even if those costs would ordinarily be included in the lawyer’s hourly rate. [Kravitz v. Sup.Ct. (Milner) (2001) 91 CA4th 1015, 1021, 111 CR2d 385, 389 (involving inspection demands)]2) [8:835.2b] Lawyers appearing pro bono?: See ¶ 8:826.1.(b) [8:835.3] Award to moving party only? According to one case, sanctions may be awarded only in favor of the party who noticed the deposition and moved for sanctions. Other parties who may have attended the deposition and joined the motion are “outsiders” and not entitled to sanctions. [Townsend v. Sup.Ct. (EMC Mortg. Co.) (1998) 61 CA4th 1431, 1438, 72 CR2d 333, 337]But cases dealing with other forms of discovery have allowed sanctions in favor of nonmoving parties. [See Trail v. Cornwell (1984) 161 CA3d 477, 483, 207 CR 679, 681, fn. 4; Calvert Fire Ins. Co. v. Cropper (1983) 141 CA3d 901, 905, 190 CR 593, 594]1) [8:835.4] Comment: The latter rule makes more practical sense, particularly in the case of depositions where parties other than the moving party incurred expenses for attending the aborted deposition.[8:835.5 - 8:835.9] Reserved.(c) [8:835.10] Limited to expenses “incurred”: Sanctions are limited to costs that have been “incurred.” Thus, the court may not award the costs of future follow-up depositions as a discovery sanction. [Tucker v. Pacific Bell Mobile Services (2010) 186 CA4th 1548, 1563, 115 CR3d 9, 19-20](2) [8:836] Against whom sanctions awardable: Monetary sanctions may be awarded against “any party, person, or attorney who unsuccessfully makes or opposes a motion to compel an answer or production.” [CCP § 2025.480(j) (emphasis added)]Thus, if the motion is granted and the deponent ordered to answer, the deponent (and any party with whom the deponent is “affiliated”) is subject to monetary sanctions.Conversely, if the motion to compel is denied, the deposing party may end up paying sanctions for making the motion.(a) [8:837] Sanctions despite no opposition: Sanctions may also be awarded against a party who fails to oppose a motion to compel, or who withdraws its opposition or furnishes the requested discovery before the motion hearing. [CRC 3.1348(a); see discussion at ¶ 8:2008 ff.][8:838 - 8:839] Reserved.(b) [8:840] Party or counsel or both: Monetary sanctions for misuse of discovery may be imposed against the party engaging in such conduct, and/or against the attorney advising the improper conduct. [CCP §§ 2023.030(a), 2025.480(j)]1) [8:840.1] Right of contribution where one pays sanctions imposed against both: Where sanctions are imposed against both attorney and client without apportionment of liability, whoever pays the sanction is entitled to pro rata contribution from the other. [Young v. Rosenthal (1989) 212 CA3d 96, 130, 260 CR 369, 390][8:841] Reserved.(c) [8:842] Nonparty deponents: Monetary sanctions are authorized even against nonparty deponents if they “unsuccessfully oppose” a motion to compel. [CCP § 2025.480(j); Person v. Farmers Ins. Group of Companies (1997) 52 CA4th 813, 818, 61 CR2d 30, 33—health care provider refused to allow inspection and copying of records until patient signed lien; see ¶ 8:1805.40]1) [8:843] Compare: Absent service of subpoena, no sanctions can be imposed against a nonparty who fails to appear for deposition (¶ 8:824).But if the nonparty witness shows up at the deposition, whether a subpoena was served becomes immaterial at that point. Personal service of the motion to compel on the nonparty deponent establishes the court’s power to order discovery (CRC 3.1346, ¶ 8:790) and to impose sanctions for refusal to answer questions at the depo. [See Marriage of Lemen (1980) 113 CA3d 769, 780-781, 170 CR 642, 647 (decided under similar provision of former law)]2) [8:844] Moving party must attempt to resolve informally: The nonparty deponent can always avoid sanctions by agreeing to provide the requested information. Before sanctions can be awarded, the moving party must show it made a reasonable and good faith attempt to resolve the issues informally. [CCP § 2025.480(b); see ¶ 8:811](3) [8:845] Court’s discretion to refuse sanctions limited: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the statute says the court “shall impose” a monetary sanction against the losing party, unless it finds:• The person or party against whom sanctions are sought acted “with substantial justification”; or• Other circumstances make imposition of sanctions “unjust.” [CCP § 2025.480(j) (emphasis added)](a) [8:846] “Substantial justification”: See discussion at ¶ 8:1964 ff.(b) [8:847] Other circumstances making sanctions “unjust”: See discussion at ¶ 8:1973.Cross-refer: Monetary sanctions on discovery motions are discussed at ¶ 8:1921 ff.[8:848 - 8:851] Reserved. d. [8:852] Sanctions for disobeying discovery orders: Once a deponent has been ordered to attend a deposition, or to answer questions or to produce documents at a resumed deposition, more severe sanctions are available for continued refusal to make discovery. [CCP § 2023.030(b)-(d)]“Disobeying a court order to provide discovery” is itself a “misuse of the discovery process” (CCP § 2023.010(g), ¶ 8:1901), for which a broad range of sanctions is authorized.

[8:905] WHEN Interrogatories May be Served:	a. [8:906] “Hold” on interrogatories by plaintiff at outset of case(1) [8:907] Purpose(2) [8:908] Court may grant leave for earlier interrogatoriesb. [8:909] “Cut-off” on discovery before trial(1) [8:910] Exceptions(2) [8:912] When proceedings “completed”(3) [8:914] Continuance of trial does not reopen discovery(4) [8:915] Parties may stipulate to later interrogatories(5) [8:916] Court may grant leave for later interrogatoriesInterrogatories may be served without leave of court any time during the action, except as stated below (¶ 8:906 ff.). [CCP § 2030.020(a)] a. [8:906] “Hold” on interrogatories by plaintiff at outset of case: Plaintiff may not serve interrogatories on defendant within the first 10 days after service of summons or defendant’s appearance in the action (whichever is first). [CCP § 2030.020(b)] (Compare: The deposition “hold” period is 20 days; see ¶ 8:439.)Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, the “hold” on plaintiff’s interrogatories is only 5 days after service of summons or defendant’s appearance in the action (whichever is first). [CCP § 2030.020(c)](1) [8:907] Purpose: The purpose of the 10-day “hold” is to give defendant an opportunity to employ counsel and to review the facts with counsel before having to respond to interrogatories.(Note that the “hold” applies only to plaintiff’s interrogatories; defendant can serve interrogatories on plaintiff during this period if it chooses to do so.)(2) [8:908] Court may grant leave for earlier interrogatories: In appropriate cases, plaintiff may seek leave of court to serve interrogatories immediately. “Good cause” must be shown, but leave may be granted ex parte if necessary. [See CCP § 2030.020(d)] b. [8:909] “Cut-off” on discovery before trial: There are two separate discovery “cut-off” dates to consider. Unless otherwise ordered:• Discovery proceedings must be completed 30 days before the initial trial date; and• Discovery motions must be heard no later than 15 days before the initial trial date. [CCP § 2024.020(a); see ¶ 8:445](1) [8:910] Exceptions: These cut-off dates do not apply in:• Unlawful detainer actions (CCP § 2024.040(b)(1)—discovery cut-off 5 days before the initial trial date);• Eminent domain proceedings (CCP § 2024.040(b)(2)); or• Cases ordered to judicial arbitration (an earlier cut-off applies in such cases; and after an arbitration award, only expert witness discovery is generally permitted), absent a stipulation or court order. [CCP § 2024.040(a)][8:911] Reserved.(2) [8:912] When proceedings “completed”: Discovery proceedings are deemed “completed” on the day the response is due (or a deposition begins). [CCP § 2024.010; see ¶ 8:448]Thus, interrogatories must be served so that the responses are due no later than 30 days before the first trial date. The minimum requirement is therefore 61 days before trial; 66 days, if served by mail (to a California address). Otherwise, an order shortening time for answers is required.Extension for weekends, holidays: See CCP § 2024.020(a) and § 2016.060, discussed at ¶ 8:445.➪ [8:913] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid problems, serve your last round of interrogatories at least 90 days before trial so that the response is due no later than 60 days before trial (not just 30). That way, if the response contains objections or inadequate answers, you’ll have time to make the required “attempt to resolve informally” (see ¶ 8:1158 ff.); and if necessary, to file a motion to compel (minimum 16 court days’ notice) and have it heard before the cut-off on discovery hearings (15 days before trial).Caution: In some congested courts, 60 days may be insufficient to schedule a hearing on a motion to compel. In many courts, you will also need to apply ex parte for an early hearing date.(3) [8:914] Continuance of trial does not reopen discovery: The 30-day and 15-day cut-off periods (¶ 8:909) are measured from the first trial date. A continuance of the trial date does not by itself reopen discovery. [CCP § 2024.020(b); see ¶ 8:450](4) [8:915] Parties may stipulate to later interrogatories: [CCP § 2024.060; see ¶ 8:452 ff.](5) [8:916] Court may grant leave for later interrogatories: [CCP § 2024.050; see ¶ 8:457 ff.] © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[8:1129] Supplemental and further responsesUnless excused by protective order, the party to whom the interrogatories are directed is under a duty to respond to each question separately, under oath, and within the time limits stated below (¶ 8:1024 ff.). [CCP § 2030.210(a)] Such response may be either:• An answer (¶ 8:1046 ff.);• An objection (¶ 8:1071 ff.); or• An election to allow inspection and copying of records (¶ 8:1065 ff.). [CCP § 2030.210(a)] A response stating “inability to respond” is legally insufficient. If the responding party lacks personal knowledge sufficient to respond, the party may so state, but only after making a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other persons or organizations. [See Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 CA4th 390, 406, 55 CR3d 751, 762] ➪ [8:1023.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: When dealing with inexperienced clients, be patient and thorough in explaining the importance of their responses to interrogatories. Otherwise, clients may treat them as bothersome details and may give incomplete answers which return to haunt them later.Avoid simply mailing interrogatories to the client with requests for answers. It is better to ask the client to come into the office, so that you can explain the process and assist with the answers.Be careful about putting your words into the client’s mouth. Interrogatory answers must disclose information known either by the client or by you (see ¶ 8:1055). But the client is the one verifying the answers. So make sure the client understands and agrees with each answer, and knows enough about the matter to withstand cross-examination on deposition or trial. a. [8:1024] Time limit for response: The response is due within 30 days from the date the interrogatories were served (extended for service by mail, overnight delivery, fax or electronically per CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013; see ¶ 9:87 ff.). [CCP §§ 2030.260(a), 2016.050]Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, responses are due within 5 days after service. [CCP § 2030.260(b)]If the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time limit is extended to the next court day closer to the trial date. [CCP § 2016.060](1) [8:1025] Court may shorten or extend time: On motion of the propounding party, the court may shorten the time for response; and conversely, on motion of the responding party, it may extend the time. [CCP § 2030.260(a)](a) [8:1026] Noticed motion required: In either event a “motion” is required—apparently meaning a formal, noticed motion.(Compare: The court may grant ex parte relief, however, limiting the parties to be served with copies of the responses; see ¶ 8:1115.)(2) [8:1027] Stipulations extending time: Likewise, the parties may stipulate for an extension of time within which to respond to interrogatories (or to particular interrogatories within the set). [CCP § 2030.270](a) [8:1028] Written confirmation required: The agreement may be informal “but it shall be confirmed in a writing that specifies the extended date for service of a response.” [CCP § 2030.270(b)]Presumably, an email qualifies as a “writing” for this purpose.(b) [8:1029] Includes right to object: Unless it expressly provides otherwise, a stipulation extending the time to “respond” applies to any form of response—i.e., objections as well as answers. [CCP § 2030.270(c)](3) [8:1030] Delay WAIVES objections: Failing to respond within the time limit waives most objections to the interrogatories, including claims of privilege and “work product” protection. [CCP § 2030.290(a); see Leach v. Sup.Ct. (Markum) (1980) 111 CA3d 902, 905-906, 169 CR 42, 43-44]Such delay also waives the option to produce writings under CCP § 2030.230 in lieu of information contained therein; see ¶ 8:1065. [CCP § 2030.290(a)](a) [8:1031] Example: P served interrogatories inquiring about matters for which D was facing criminal charges. D failed to respond within the time permitted. His later attempts to avoid discovery by claiming self-incrimination were unavailing: “Defendants had ample opportunity to timely raise their Fifth Amendment objection and failed to do so, thereby waiving their privilege.” [Brown v. Sup.Ct. (Boorstin) (1986) 180 CA3d 701, 712, 226 CR 10, 16 (emphasis added)](b) [8:1031.1] Exceptions to waiver: There may be some case law exceptions to the waiver rule stated in § 2030.290(a):• [8:1031.2] Relief through protective order: One case holds that a party may, upon a proper showing, obtain a protective order limiting further determination of trade secrets even after the party waived its right to object to discovery of the secrets. [See Stadish v. Sup.Ct. (Southern Calif. Gas Co.) (1999) 71 CA4th 1130, 1144, 84 CR2d 350, 358 (dealing with inspection demands), discussed at ¶ 8:1454.2]• [8:1031.3] Privacy rights: In light of the sensitive nature of privacy rights, courts are reluctant to find a waiver and, even if a waiver is found, are likely to grant relief from it (¶ 8:1032). [Heda v. Sup.Ct. (Davis) (1990) 225 CA3d 525, 530, 275 CR 136, 138-139; see ¶ 8:1101.1 ff.](c) [8:1032] Relief from waiver: The court has statutory power to grant relief from such waiver in accordance with the procedures discussed below (¶ 8:1033 ff.). [CCP § 2030.290(a)]1) [8:1033] Noticed motion required: A noticed motion for relief from waiver is required. (I.e., such relief cannot be granted ex parte, or where the only motion pending is a motion to compel.) [CCP § 2030.290(a)]2) [8:1034] Delayed responses must be served: The party seeking belatedly to assert some objection must show that the party has belatedly served responses “in substantial compliance” with that party’s duty to respond under CCP § 2030.210(a). [CCP § 2030.290(a)(1) (emphasis added)]a) [8:1035] Comment: Any form of response under § 2030.210 is permissible—i.e., answer, objection or election to allow inspection of records. But it must be in “substantial compliance” with the duty to respond. I.e., there must be a full and fair response to each interrogatory; so that all questions are answered other than those to which the belated objections relate.3) [8:1036] Excuse for delayed response: The declarations must establish that the party’s failure to serve a timely response resulted from “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” [CCP § 2030.290(a)(2) (emphasis added)]a) [8:1037] Application: The judge has broad discretion in this area, but not every “excuse” is excusable. [See Mannino v. Sup.Ct. (Southern Calif. Edison Co.) (1983) 142 CA3d 776, 778-779, 191 CR 163, 164-165][8:1038] For example, D’s attorney offered no explanation for delay in responding to P’s interrogatories other than his client’s failure to sign the verification on time. D’s attorney had requested one extension from P’s counsel, but failed to ask for another. These facts did not show “good cause” for relief from waiver. [See Mannino v. Sup.Ct. (Southern Calif. Edison Co.), supra, 142 CA3d at 778-779, 191 CR at 164-165 (decided under former law applying CCP § 473)](d) [8:1038.1] No relief under CCP § 473(b): Because the Discovery Act contains specific provisions for relief for delayed responses, relief cannot be obtained under CCP § 473(b) (authorizing relief from default generally for “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”; see ¶ 5:282 ff.). [See Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1107, 1 CR2d 222, 228, discussed at ¶ 8:10.5]1) [8:1038.2] Compare: Where there is no analogous Discovery Act provision, CCP § 473(b) relief is available. [Zellerino v. Brown, supra, 235 CA3d at 1104-1106, 1 CR2d at 226-228—CCP § 473 relief granted for untimely demand for expert witness exchange because no Discovery Act provision for such relief]2) [8:1038.3] Significance: It is often easier to obtain relief under CCP § 473(b). See discussion at ¶ 8:10.14 ff. b. [8:1039] Format of response: The following rules govern the format of the response:(1) [8:1040] Opening paragraph: The first paragraph immediately below the title of the case must state:• The identity of the responding party;• The identity of the propounding party;• The set number of the propounding party’s interrogatories being responded to. [CCP § 2030.210(b)]If the response is a supplemental or further response (answers to supplemental interrogatories, or after court order for further response), the words “supplemental responses” or “further response” must be included. [CRC 3.1000(a)]See Form 8:18.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(a) [8:1041] Example: “DEFENDANT DONALD DALTON’S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF PAUL PROCTOR’S SECOND SET OF INTERROGATORIES”[8:1042] Reserved.(2) [8:1043] Numbering: Each response (whether answer, objection or election to furnish documents) must be in the same order and must be identified by the same number or letter as the interrogatory to which it relates. [CCP § 2030.210(c)](3) [8:1044] Question need not be repeated: The text of the interrogatory need not be repeated in the response (except as may be required with electronic exchange of interrogatories and responses, ¶ 8:1045). [CCP § 2030.210(c); CRC 3.1000(b)](4) [8:1045] Electronic exchange of interrogatories and responses: Nonetheless, it is generally desirable to have the questions and answers in a single document. Upon request, a party must provide the document propounding interrogatories in electronic format within three court days of the request. If this is provided, the responding party must include the text of the interrogatory preceding any response. Upon request, a party responding to the interrogatories must provide the responses to the propounding party in an electronic format within three court days of the request. [CCP § 2030.210(d)(1), (2), (6)] c. [8:1046] Answers to interrogatories: As stated earlier, the response may consist either of answers, objections, or election to allow inspection and copying of records. [CCP § 2030.210(a)]The following rules apply to answers:(1) [8:1047] Duty to provide “complete” answers: Each answer in the response must be “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits. If an interrogatory cannot be answered completely, it shall be answered to the extent possible.” [CCP § 2030.220(a), (b) (emphasis added)](a) [8:1048] False or evasive answers improper: “Parties must state the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in answering written interrogatories.” [Scheiding v. Dinwiddie Const. Co. (1999) 69 CA4th 64, 76, 81 CR2d 360, 368 (internal quotes omitted); see CCP § 2023.010(f)—evasive response is ground for sanctions (¶ 8:1920)]• [8:1048.1] Where the question is specific and explicit, an answer that supplies only a portion of the information sought is improper. It is also improper to provide “deftly worded conclusionary answers designed to evade a series of explicit questions.” [Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 783, 149 CR 499, 509]• [8:1048.2] Where an interrogatory asks for the names of all witnesses to a particular event then known to the responding party, a response omitting the name of a known witness could subject the adversary to unfair surprise at trial and therefore may result in an order excluding that witness’ testimony. [See R & B Auto Ctr., Inc. v. Farmers Group, Inc. (2006) 140 CA4th 327, 356, 44 CR3d 426, 450; and ¶ 8:2390](b) [8:1049] Referencing other documents improper: It is not proper to answer by stating, “See my deposition” or “See the complaint herein.” If the question requires reference to some other document, it should be identified and its contents summarized so that the answer by itself is fully responsive to the interrogatory. [Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 783-784, 149 CR 499, 510]Alternatively, where answering the interrogatory would require a compilation or summary of information contained in documents, the answering party may opt to allow the interrogating party to inspect the books and records that contain the information (see ¶ 8:1065 ff.).➪ [8:1050] PRACTICE POINTER: Sometimes several interrogatories appear to ask for the same information. It is usually not a good idea to answer, “See my answer to Question No. …” or “I incorporate my answer to Question No. …” The reason is that the questions may differ in some detail, so there is a chance that your prior answers will not be completely responsive to the present question. Take the time and trouble to provide a full answer to the present question.[8:1050.1 - 8:1050.4] Reserved.(c) [8:1050.5] Responding to interrogatories re privileged documents: An interrogatory may ask the responding party to identify documents as to which a privilege is claimed. The existence of a privileged document is not generally privileged. Therefore, an adequate response must include a description of the documents, even if the party has the right to object to a demand for their production. The responding party need not provide a privilege log (¶ 8:192.10) in responding to the interrogatory. [Hernandez v. Sup.Ct. (Acheson Indus., Inc.) (2003) 112 CA4th 285, 293, 4 CR3d 883, 890]Compare—request for document production: A privilege log may be required, however, when objecting to a CCP § 2031.010 et seq. demand for document production based on a claim of privilege or work product protection (CCP § 2031.240(c)). See ¶ 8:1474.5.[8:1050.6 - 8:1050.9] Reserved.(d) [8:1050.10] Caution—incomplete answers may expose responding party to summary judgment: “Factually devoid” interrogatory answers may come back to haunt the responding party if the opposing party moves for summary judgment. The responding party’s incomplete answers can be used to satisfy the moving party’s burden on summary judgment to show there is no evidence of a triable issue of material fact. [See Field v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n (2022) 79 CA5th 703, 708, 294 CR3d 822, 825 (quoting text); Union Bank v. Sup.Ct. (Demetry) (1995) 31 CA4th 573, 580-581, 37 CR2d 653, 657; Collin v. Calportland Co. (2014) 228 CA4th 582, 591, 176 CR3d 279, 287—factually devoid discovery responses raised inference plaintiff could not prove causation]1) [8:1050.10a] Example: In suit against bank for wrongful foreclosure, P answered interrogatory that she was “Unsure” whether notice of trustee’s sale was mailed to her. She could not later avoid summary judgment by submitting a declaration that the notice was improper because she never got it. P’s interrogatory response, which was not unambiguous and forthright, was discovery abuse. P could have, but did not, seek to amend her interrogatory answer. Trial courts are “free to disregard a later declaration that hopes to supplant tactical or slothful ambiguity with tardy specificity.” [Field v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n (2022) 79 CA5th 703, 707-708, 294 CR3d 822, 824-825—“A party opposing summary judgment may not move the target after the proponent has launched its [summary judgment] arrow”](2) [8:1051] Duty to obtain information: “If the responding party does not have personal knowledge sufficient to respond fully to an interrogatory, that party shall so state, but shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain the information by inquiry to other natural persons or organizations, except where the information is equally available to the propounding party.” [CCP § 2030.220(c) (emphasis added); Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Settles) (1998) 64 CA4th 1496, 1504, 76 CR2d 95, 100 (citing text)][8:1052] Reserved.[8:1053] Compare—depositions: An individual deponent is required to answer only according to the deponent’s personal knowledge at the time of deposition (see ¶ 8:705). The deponent is not under any duty to investigate or search out information. But the rules are different for interrogatories because, unlike depositions, interrogatory answers are prepared with the assistance of counsel. Therefore, a broader duty of response is justified. [Field v. U.S. Bank Nat’l Ass’n (2022) 79 CA5th 703, 708, 294 CR3d 822, 825 (citing text)](a) [8:1054] Information available from sources under party’s control: In answering interrogatories, a party must furnish information available from sources under the party’s control: “[A party] cannot plead ignorance to information which can be obtained from sources under his control.” [Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 782, 149 CR 499, 509; Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Settles) (1998) 64 CA4th 1496, 1504, 76 CR2d 95, 100 (citing text)]1) [8:1055] Party’s lawyer: A party must disclose nonprivileged facts known to the party’s lawyer, even if the party has no personal knowledge of such facts. [Smith v. Sup.Ct. (Alfred) (1961) 189 CA2d 6, 11-12, 11 CR 165, 169—names of witnesses, existence of photographs, etc.]2) [8:1056] Agents or employees: Interrogatories directed to a corporation or other entity require it to disclose information known to all persons in its employ, not merely the particular officer or agent designated to verify the responses: “While a corporation or public agency may select the person who answers interrogatories in its behalf, it has a corresponding duty to obtain information from all sources under its control—information which may not be personally known to the answering agent.” [Gordon v. Sup.Ct. (U.Z. Mfg. Co.) (1984) 161 CA3d 157, 167-168, 207 CR 327, 333 (emphasis added)— corporation bound by initial, untruthful answers given by employee who answered interrogatories on its behalf]3) [8:1057] Family members: In answering interrogatories, a party is expected to make good faith inquiry of the party’s family members, at least where they are shown to be cooperating with the party in the lawsuit. [Jones v. Sup.Ct. (Benny) (1981) 119 CA3d 534, 552, 174 CR 148, 159 (disapproved on other grounds by Williams v. Sup.Ct. (Marshalls of CA, LLC) (2017) 3 C5th 531, 557, 220 CR3d 472, 494 & fn. 8)]• [8:1058] Example: Daughter sued for birth defects allegedly caused by Mother’s ingestion of dangerous drug. In answering interrogatories, Daughter was under a duty to furnish information known to Mother, because Mother was closely cooperating in the suit. Mother (not a party to the action) was free, however, to decline to answer for privacy reasons or otherwise. [Jones v. Sup.Ct. (Benny) (1981) 119 CA3d 534, 552-553, 174 CR 148, 159]4) [8:1059] Expert trial witnesses: An expert who has been retained by a party and designated as a trial witness may be treated as the agent of that party, so that, in answering interrogatories, the party may be required to furnish facts known to the expert. [Sigerseth v. Sup.Ct. (Canoga Park Lutheran Church) (1972) 23 CA3d 427, 433, 100 CR 185, 188]➪ [8:1060] PRACTICE POINTER: Don’t rely on interrogatories for this purpose. Expert witnesses are usually not designated until 50 days before trial (see CCP §§ 2034.220 ff. dealing with exchange of expert witness lists, ¶ 8:1649.2). Discovery from the designated experts may continue until 15 days before trial (see CCP § 2024.030, ¶ 8:1690). However, depositions, rather than interrogatories, should be used at that point.(b) [8:1061] Information presumably available to responding party: Another consequence of the duty to attempt to obtain information is that “I don’t know” or “Unknown” are insufficient answers to matters presumably known to the responding party. (Example: Question asks, “What is the name and address of each physician who treated you for the injuries described in your complaint?”)The responding party must make a reasonable effort to obtain whatever information is sought; and if unable to do so, must specify why the information is unavailable and what efforts the responding party made to obtain it. [See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 782, 149 CR 499, 509](c) [8:1062] Exception—no duty to provide information equally available to propounding party: The duty to make reasonable efforts to obtain requested information does not apply to “information … equally available to the propounding party.” [CCP § 2030.220(c); see Bunnell v. Sup.Ct. (California Life Ins. Co.) (1967) 254 CA2d 720, 723-724, 62 CR 458, 461-462—“equally available” refers to same amount of research or labor (see ¶ 8:1064.1)]• [8:1063] Thus, there is no duty to search out matters of public record. [See Bunnell v. Sup.Ct. (California Life Ins. Co.) (1967) 254 CA2d 720, 723-724, 62 CR 458, 461]• [8:1064] Nor is the responding party under a duty to make inquiry from independent witnesses (persons not the party’s agents or employees) in order to answer interrogatories. [Holguin v. Sup.Ct. (Hoage) (1972) 22 CA3d 812, 821, 99 CR 653, 658]• [8:1064.1] But if a responding party has the information, the fact that it is also available from other sources may not relieve the party from turning it over if the information is less easily available from the other source than it is from the party. [Bunnell v. Sup.Ct. (California Life Ins. Co.) (1967) 254 CA2d 720, 723-724, 62 CR 458, 461-462] d. [8:1065] Option to allow interrogating party to inspect files and records: If the interrogatory seeks information contained in files and records, the responding party is under a duty to provide “complete and straightforward” answers. [CCP § 2030.220(a)]However, if the answer would necessitate making a compilation or summary of information contained in such records, the responding party has the option to allow the interrogating party to inspect and copy the records in question. In effect, the responding party may shift the burden of compiling the information to the interrogating party. [CCP § 2030.230]Exercising the option is equivalent to a statement under oath that the records identified actually exist and that they contain the information necessary to provide a “complete and straightforward” answer to the interrogatory. [See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 784, 149 CR 499, 510](1) [8:1066] Requirements: To answer an interrogatory in this manner, the following must be shown:• A compilation, abstract, audit or summary of the responding party’s records is necessary in order to answer the interrogatory; and• No such compilation, etc. presently exists; and• The burden or expense of preparing or making it would be substantially the same for the interrogating party as for the responding party. [CCP § 2030.230](2) [8:1067] How option exercised: To utilize this option, the response must:• Be timely (delay waives the right to exercise the option; see CCP § 2030.290(a), ¶ 8:1030); and• Refer to CCP § 2030.230; and• Specify the documents from which the answer may be derived or ascertained. [CCP § 2030.230](a) [8:1068] Identification of records: The responding party must describe the records from which the compilation or summary can be made with sufficient particularity that they can be easily located. (For example, “see my files and records” is not a proper response.) [Fuss v. Sup.Ct. (Rosenthal) (1969) 273 CA2d 807, 815-817, 78 CR 583, 588-589](3) [8:1069] Inspection and copying: Upon exercising the option, the responding party must then afford the interrogating party a “reasonable opportunity” to inspect and copy the records or documents identified. [CCP § 2030.230]➪ [8:1070] PRACTICE POINTER: If you represent the responding party, be careful about exercising this option. Its purpose supposedly is to save you (or your client) the time required to prepare a summary or compilation.However, you should never open up your client’s records to inspection by opposing counsel unless you have already reviewed them and know what’s in them.In many cases, a thorough review will require you to spend almost the same time as would be required to make the compilation sought by the interrogatory, so the time savings won’t be as great as supposed.Moreover, if the compilation could result in evidence admissible at trial, it will be better for you to prepare the compilation yourself. e. [8:1071] Objections: In lieu of answering (¶ 8:1046 ff.) or allowing inspection of records (¶ 8:1065 ff.), the responding party may serve objections. Each objection must be stated separately (no objections to entire set), and must bear the same number or letter as the interrogatory to which it is directed. [CCP § 2030.210(a)(3); see ¶ 8:1045 (electronic exchange of interrogatories and responses)]Objections must be specific. A motion to compel lies where objections are “too general.” [CCP § 2030.300(a)(3); see Korea Data Systems Co. Ltd. v. Sup.Ct. (Aamazing Technologies Corp.) (1997) 51 CA4th 1513, 1516, 59 CR2d 925, 926—objecting party subject to sanctions for “boiler plate” objections; and ¶ 8:1920](1) [8:1072] As alternative to protective order: Some grounds for objection to interrogatories would also be ground for a protective order: e.g., that the interrogatories are burdensome and oppressive (¶ 8:1007). [CCP § 2030.090(b)]But the responding party does not have to seek a protective order against “burdensome or oppressive” interrogatories. The responding party can raise this by objection to the interrogatories (see ¶ 8:1022).(a) [8:1073] Burden on propounding party to seek order compelling answer: Once an objection is made, it is up to the propounding party to decide whether to take the matter to court. If the objection is believed to be without merit, the propounding party must file a motion to compel answers (¶ 8:1136 ff.). And, the motion must be filed promptly or the matter is waived (¶ 8:1146).(b) [8:1074] Burden on responding party to justify objection: If a motion to compel answers is filed, the burden will then be on the objecting party to establish whatever facts are necessary to justify the objection. Usually, this is done by filing declarations in opposition to the motion to compel (see ¶ 8:1179).➪ [8:1075] PRACTICE POINTER: To save time and effort, the responding party may wish to set forth such facts in the response to the interrogatories. Doing so may dissuade the propounding party from filing a motion to compel answers. And, even if the motion is made, it may lessen the burden of preparing the requisite declarations to establish the facts.(2) [8:1076] Grounds for objection: The grounds for objecting to interrogatories are even more limited than the grounds for objecting to deposition questions. There is less concern as to the form of questioning because the answering party will have the assistance of counsel in preparing responses. [Greyhound Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Clay) (1961) 56 C2d 355, 392, 15 CR 90, 110, fn. 16 (superseded by statute on other grounds)]➪ [8:1076.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Avoid general or “boilerplate” objections and other equivocal responses that have the effect of obstructing discovery. Judges usually will not tolerate such responses and if a motion to compel is filed, substantial sanctions are a real likelihood.(a) [8:1077] Improper objections: In addition, the following are generally not valid grounds for objecting to an interrogatory:• [8:1078] Question calls for hearsay. [Greyhound Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Clay) (1961) 56 C2d 355, 392-393, 15 CR 90, 109-110—hearsay discoverable as long as it may lead to admissible evidence]• [8:1079] Question calls for opinion or conclusion. [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans) (1961) 56 C2d 407, 416-417, 15 CR 119, 123]• [8:1080] Question has been asked and answered at deposition. [Coy v. Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 C2d 210, 218, 23 CR 393, 397]• [8:1081] Question assumes facts not in evidence. [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 421, 15 CR at 126]• [8:1082] Interrogating party is “conducting a fishing expedition.” [Greyhound Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Clay) (1961) 56 C2d 355, 384, 15 CR 90, 104][8:1083] Reserved.• [8:1084] Question is “ambiguous, confusing or overbroad.” Courts generally do not sustain this kind of objection unless the question is totally unintelligible. The answering party owes a duty to respond in good faith as best it can. [See Deyo v. Kilbourne (1978) 84 CA3d 771, 783, 149 CR 499, 509—verification of answers is “in effect a declaration that the party has disclosed all information which is available to him” (emphasis added)](Compare: But if the question is so broad that it is “oppressive,” an objection can be stated on that ground; see ¶ 8:1094 ff.)• [8:1085] Question seeks “confidential information.” Again, this is not a proper objection; the answering party should seek a protective order to excuse the duty to answer. [Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Rolfe) (1968) 263 CA2d 12, 23, 69 CR 348, 355] (The court may also order the response be made, but perhaps subject to a confidentiality order.)(Compare: If the information sought is privileged or protected by the constitutional right of privacy, rather than simply “confidential,” an objection may be stated on those grounds; see ¶ 8:1088.)• [8:1086] Objections to the entire set of interrogatories will not be sustained if any of the questions is proper. [Wooldridge v. Mounts (1962) 199 CA2d 620, 628, 18 CR 806, 811]• [8:1086.1] Objections that do not actually apply to any responsive answer (e.g., “attorney-client privilege” when there is no such responsive material).[8:1086.2 - 8:1086.4] Reserved.• [8:1086.5] Where an interrogatory asks about the existence of a document, an objection on the ground of privilege is improper. I.e., the document must be described although a privilege claim may later be asserted concerning its contents. [Best Products, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Granatelli Motorsports, Inc.) (2004) 119 CA4th 1181, 1190, 15 CR3d 154, 160](b) [8:1087] PROPER objections: Objections to interrogatories may be sustained on the following grounds:• [8:1088] Question seeks information protected by privilege, work product, or right of privacy (¶ 8:109 ff.).• [8:1089] Question exceeds permissible scope of discovery; i.e., it seeks information “not relevant to the subject matter of the action” (¶ 8:65 ff.).• [8:1090] More than 35 specially prepared interrogatories have been served (in the present set or together with previous sets) without a “declaration of necessity” under CCP § 2030.050. [See CCP § 2030.040(a); and ¶ 8:939](Compare: But where a “declaration of necessity” accompanies the interrogatories, no objection lies solely because of the number of interrogatories served. The appropriate procedure is to challenge the “declaration of necessity” by a motion for protective order (CCP § 2030.090(b)(2); see ¶ 8:954). However, a “burdensome and oppressive” objection might still lie; see ¶ 8:1094.)• [8:1091] Question is improper in form because not “full and complete in and of itself”; or (if not an Official Form Interrogatory) because it contains:• Subparts (CCP § 2030.060(f)); or• “Compound, conjunctive or disjunctive” questions (CCP § 2030.060(f)); or• A preface or instructions (CCP § 2030.060(d)); or• Special definitions of terms carried over from question to question are not capitalized. (See CCP § 2030.060(e)).• [8:1092] Question seeks content or production of documents; interrogatories cannot be used for this purpose (¶ 8:993). (But they can be used to obtain description and location of the documents sought.) [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans) (1961) 56 C2d 407, 419, 15 CR 119, 125]• [8:1093] Question seeks information equally available to interrogating party (¶ 8:1062). [Alpine Mutual Water Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Susana Knolls Mutual Water Co.) (1968) 259 CA2d 45, 53, 66 CR 250, 255—interrogating party cannot force answering party to search public records to ascertain answers to interrogatories]• [8:1094] Question is “burdensome and oppressive”: The court has power to issue protective orders to protect a party against “unwarranted annoyance, embarrassment, or oppression” (CCP § 2030.090(b), see ¶ 8:1008).“Oppression” may also be raised as ground for objection, in lieu of making a motion for protective order. [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 418, 15 CR at 123-124]But it is a weak ground because difficult to justify if a motion to compel answers is made.➪ [8:1094.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Even so, it is a good idea to raise the objection where grounds exist. The party seeking discovery must attempt to resolve the matter with you informally before moving to compel answers (¶ 8:1158).You can use the opportunity to negotiate limits on the interrogatories.1) [8:1095] “Burdensome” by itself not enough: The ground for objection is “oppression.” Thus, it is not enough that the questions will require a lot of work to answer. It must be shown that the burden of answering is so unjust that it amounts to oppression. [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 417-418, 15 CR at 124]2) [8:1096] “Oppression”: In determining whether the burden is unjust, a weighing process is required: It must appear that the amount of work required to answer the questions is so great, and the utility of the information sought so minimal, that it would defeat the ends of justice to require the answers. [See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Rolfe) (1968) 263 CA2d 12, 19, 69 CR 348, 352; and West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 417-418, 15 CR at 124]a) [8:1097] Showing required: On a motion to compel answers, the burden is on the objecting party to sustain the objection by detailed evidence showing precisely how much work is required to answer; conclusionary statements are not sufficient. [West Pico Furniture Co. of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific Finance Loans), supra, 56 C2d at 417, 15 CR at 123-124—declaration by manager that search of 78 branch offices would be required was insufficient; should show hours required][8:1097.1] A discovery request was held “oppressive” where uncontradicted declarations showed that response would require review of over 13,000 insurance claims files, requiring 5 claims adjusters working full time for 6 weeks each. [Mead Reinsurance Co. v. Sup.Ct. (City of Laguna Beach) (1986) 188 CA3d 313, 318, 232 CR 752, 754—involving document demand; see ¶ 8:1475.1]b) [8:1098] Contents of business records; effect of CCP § 2030.230 option: If the information sought is a compilation of entries in files and records, the answering party has the option to allow the interrogating party to inspect and copy the records (CCP § 2030.230; ¶ 8:1065). An answering party who has this option available, but declines to use it (because the answering party doesn’t want the adverse party inspecting the answering party’s records), cannot rely on a “burdensome and oppressive” objection. The answering party must suffer the burden. [Brotsky v. State Bar (1962) 57 C2d 287, 304, 19 CR 153, 162]c) [8:1099] Number of interrogatories as factor: Where more than 35 specially prepared interrogatories are accompanied by a “declaration of necessity” under CCP § 2030.050, any challenge to the number of questions must be by motion for protective order (CCP § 2030.090(b)(2); see ¶ 8:954). Therefore, a “burdensome and oppressive” objection would not lie solely on the basis of the number of questions asked. Other reasons must be shown.3) [8:1100] Court may limit questions rather than excuse answers altogether: Discovery should not be denied if the information sought has any relevancy to the subject matter. Therefore, even if interrogatories are found to be “burdensome and oppressive,” the court should not simply sustain the objection and thereby excuse any answer. Rather, the trial court should limit the question to a reasonable scope. [Borse v. Sup.Ct. (Southern Pac. Co.) (1970) 7 CA3d 286, 289, 86 CR 559, 561](3) [8:1101] Failure to object as waiver: If the party to whom the interrogatories are directed does not timely respond, most objections are waived. [CCP § 2030.290(a); see ¶ 8:1030]Moreover, there is no provision for filing subsequent objections. Thus, even where a timely response is made, the responding party cannot later add objections without a court order granting relief from the waiver. [Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Spyglass Homeowners Ass’n) (1997) 59 CA4th 263, 273, 69 CR2d 112, 118 (citing text)](See further discussion of waiver and relief from waiver at ¶ 8:1030 ff.)(a) [8:1101.1] Compare—delayed privacy objection: However, one case has permitted a party to raise a privacy objection after the initial response to the interrogatories. [Heda v. Sup.Ct. (Davis) (1990) 225 CA3d 525, 529-530, 275 CR 136, 138-139—D objected to questions re his medical records solely on relevance grounds; P moved to compel, demonstrating relevancy; D then raised privacy objection; “Plaintiff now claims that failure also to object on privacy grounds forever waives defendant’s privacy rights. Plaintiff cites no persuasive authority for such a draconian rule … [W]aivers of constitutional rights are not lightly found” (emphasis added)][8:1101.2] Comment: This seems incorrect. The court did not consider or discuss CCP former § 2030(k), now § 2030.290(a), and later cases which hold that omitting a claim of privilege in the original discovery response waives the objection. [Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Spyglass Homeowners Ass’n) (1997) 59 CA4th 263, 273, 69 CR2d 112, 118; see ¶ 8:200]The outcome may be different when a responding party fails to preserve privacy rights of third parties (see ¶ 8:319.2).[8:1101.3 - 8:1101.4] Reserved.(4) [8:1101.5] Standards of professionalism: Various guidelines exist to discourage abusive discovery. The Los Angeles Superior Court has adopted certain of these guidelines as “civility in litigation recommendations to members of the bar,” including the following:• “Objections to interrogatories should be based on a good faith belief in their merit and not be made for the purpose of withholding relevant information. If an interrogatory is objectionable only in part, the unobjectionable portion should be answered.” [L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(g)(3) (emphasis added)]Comment: Although these guidelines do not have the force of law and parties may not be sanctioned directly for violations, the conduct proscribed may nevertheless be sanctionable as a discovery misuse (see ¶ 8:1901).  f. [8:1102] Signature and verification: The responses must be signed under oath by the party to whom the interrogatories are directed. If they contain an objection, the attorney must also sign the response; and if it consists entirely of objections, only the attorney’s signature is required. [CCP § 2030.250(a), (c); see Blue Ridge Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Kippen) (1988) 202 CA3d 339, 344, 248 CR 346, 349—responses consisting entirely of objections need not be verified](1) [8:1102.1] Answers and objections intermixed: Where the response contains both answer and objections, there is no need to verify that portion of the response containing the objections. But the portion containing fact-specific responses must be verified. [Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 CA4th 651, 657, 46 CR2d 925, 928; see ¶ 8:1113.1](2) [8:1103] Form: In practice, the responding party usually signs a verification form attached to or inserted at the end of the answers: “I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.” [See CCP § 2015.5](a) [8:1104] “Information and belief” insufficient: A verification on behalf of an individual stating “I am informed and believe that the matters stated herein are true” is insufficient. This form is acceptable for pleadings (see CCP § 446, ¶ 6:225 ff.), but not for interrogatory answers.Reason: Interrogatory answers must contain the responding party’s personal knowledge or state the inability to provide such information despite a reasonable and good faith effort to obtain it (see CCP § 2030.220(c); ¶ 8:1051).Answers on “information and belief” indicate the information is hearsay, not personal knowledge, and fail to state that the requisite effort has been made to obtain first-hand information.(b) [8:1104.1] Verification by “Doe” sufficient: Where plaintiff files an action under a fictitious name to preserve anonymity (¶ 2:136.5 ff.), plaintiff may verify discovery responses by signing the fictitious name. [Doe v. Sup.Ct. (Luster) (2011) 194 CA4th 750, 756, 123 CR3d 557, 561—trial court erred in requiring plaintiff to provide verifications in her true name](3) [8:1105] Verification by entity party: If the responding party is a corporation, partnership or other entity, “one of its officers or agents” must execute the verification on its behalf. [CCP § 2030.250(b)]The usual corporate verification form is as follows: “I am an officer of XYZ, Inc. and am authorized to make this verification on its behalf. I have read the foregoing Responses to Interrogatories and know its contents. I am informed and believe that the matters stated therein are true and on that ground certify or declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the same are true and correct.”However, this form raises several problems:(a) [8:1106] Signer’s knowledge of facts; use of “information and belief” form? The person designated to verify the corporation’s responses may not have personal knowledge of all facts stated therein. (The entity is obliged to provide facts known to any agent or employee, but the particular officer verifying may not have personal knowledge of all of them.)Under such circumstances, “information and belief” is the only realistic way to verify answers on behalf of the entity. While nothing in the Discovery Act expressly authorizes verification of interrogatories on “information and belief,” this is entirely proper. [Perry v. Kia Motors America, Inc. (2023) 91 CA5th 1088, 1097, 308 CR3d 696, 703-704 (citing text)]➪ [8:1106.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Until the Legislature clarifies this issue, consider modifying the usual declaration form to reflect these realities. For example, a corporate secretary’s declaration might state: “I certify and declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that:— I am the Secretary of XYZ, Inc.; and— I have made reasonable efforts to review relevant documents, records and information possessed by or known to XYZ, Inc. and its officers and employees; and— Based on such review, the facts stated herein are true and correct.”This is similar to federal practice for entity discovery verifications. See detailed discussion in Stevenson & Fitzgerald, Rutter Group Prac. Guide: Federal Civ. Pro. Before Trial (TRG), Ch. 11.(b) [8:1107] Signer’s authority? Another problem is whether the signer’s allegations that the signer is an “officer” and “authorized” to verify on behalf of the corporation establish the signer’s authority to do so; or whether resolutions of the board of directors, etc. are required. Again, the Discovery Act is silent on this point; and there is no known case authority.Many judges would hold the above form (¶ 8:1106.1) sufficient prima facie.(c) [8:1107a] Compare—when no officer or agent of the party: When a corporation has no officer or agent to verify responses due to dissolution and resignation of officers, its lawyer may verify if authorized to waive the attorney-client privilege (¶ 8:1109 ff.). If the corporation cannot or will not waive privilege, the responses must be treated as unverified (see ¶ 8:1113 ff.). [Melendrez v. Sup.Ct. (Special Elec. Co., Inc.) (2013) 215 CA4th 1343, 1357-1358, 156 CR3d 335, 347]• [8:1107b] Corporation filed for bankruptcy, following which it existed only as a shell through which personal injury (asbestos) lawsuits were passed on to Insurer for resolution. In one suit, Corporation’s attorney (hired by Insurer) filed substantive responses to requests for admission but stated that the responses could not be verified because Corporation had no officers, directors or agents who could do so. Because Attorney could not verify the responses without waiving the attorney-client privilege, Corporation was required to elect or appoint an officer or director to decide the waiver issue. If this was not possible because Corporation no longer existed, the privilege transferred to Insurer. If the privilege was not waived, the responses would be treated as unverified on a motion to compel. [Melendrez v. Sup.Ct. (Special Elec. Co., Inc.), supra, 215 CA4th at 1357-1358, 156 CR3d at 347](4) [8:1107c] Verification by minor, incompetent parties: A guardian ad litem is authorized to verify interrogatories on behalf of a minor or incompetent ward. I.e., even lacking personal knowledge of the facts, the guardian ad litem has authority, subject to the court’s ultimate supervision, to verify proper responses to interrogatories on behalf of the ward. Otherwise, the ward, the real party in interest, could evade discovery altogether. [Regency Health Services, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Settles) (1998) 64 CA4th 1496, 1504, 76 CR2d 95, 100; see also Prob.C. § 2462—authorizing guardians ad litem to “institute and maintain” actions for benefit of ward (emphasis added)](5) [8:1107.1] Attorney verifying on behalf of client: As discussed above (¶ 8:1102), an attorney must sign responses containing objections. The question here is whether an attorney may verify responses on behalf of the client.(a) [8:1108] Generally improper: CCP § 2030.250(a) requires verification by the responding party. Therefore, an attorney cannot properly verify interrogatory responses on behalf of a client. [See Steele v. Totah (1986) 180 CA3d 545, 550, 225 CR 635, 637—dealing with verification of RFAs, discussed at ¶ 8:1363](Compare—pleadings: Pleadings can be verified by an attorney on behalf of the client under certain circumstances. See CCP § 446, ¶ 6:320.)(b) [8:1109] Permissible if attorney authorized agent: However, a corporation, partnership or other entity may authorize its attorney or someone on its legal staff to sign on its behalf—i.e., as an agent of the corporation. [CCP § 2030.250(b)]1) [8:1110] Verification must so state: In such event, the verification should state that the signer is the authorized agent of the corporation to sign the responses on its behalf and not simply that the signer is the attorney for the corporation.2) [8:1111] Waiver of privilege or work product protection: If an attorney signs responses as agent of a corporation or other entity, the entity waives any attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to subsequent discovery from the attorney concerning the sources from whom the information was obtained. [CCP § 2030.250(b)]This waiver is “narrowly circumscribed,” however, and should not subject the verifying attorney to “lengthy further discovery.” [Melendrez v. Sup.Ct. (Special Elec. Co., Inc.) (2013) 215 CA4th 1343, 1352-1353, 156 CR3d 335, 342 (noting that there is “no indication [in the statutes] that a deposition of the verifying attorney would ever be necessary in any particular case”)]Comment: The purpose of the waiver rule is to prevent a party from “hiding behind” the privileges otherwise assertable by its attorney where it has the attorney sign its interrogatory answers.➪ [8:1112] PRACTICE POINTER: Avoid verifying discovery documents (or pleadings) on behalf of a client.• First, it is rarely necessary, because opposing counsel will normally give you an extension of time to obtain your client’s verification when the client is out of town, etc. (And, if opposing counsel won’t, the court almost certainly will.) Even if the client is out of town, you can send the answers to the client electronically, by overnight delivery or by mail for verification. (Verification outside of California is valid as long as the declaration states that it is “under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California”; see CCP § 2015.5.)• More importantly, your verifying such documents could subject you to being called as a witness by the opposing party—i.e., being deposed or subpoenaed to testify at trial regarding the facts you verified and the sources of those facts. While such testimony may not be “necessary” (see ¶ 8:1111), that does not mean the opposing party won’t try to obtain it or that a court might not order it. Further, if your testimony relates to a contested matter in the case, you could be disqualified from representing the client at trial if the client does not execute a written consent. [CRPC 3.7]• Moreover, as CCP § 2030.250(b) now makes clear, when your client is a corporation or other entity, your verification on its behalf constitutes a waiver of at least some privileged communications and some of your own work product.(6) [8:1113] Effect of unverified response: Where a verification is required (see ¶ 8:1102 ff.), an unverified response is ineffective; it is the equivalent of no response at all. [See Appleton v. Sup.Ct. (Cook) (1988) 206 CA3d 632, 636, 253 CR 762, 764](a) [8:1113.1] Compare—responses containing both answers and objections: But no verification is required to preserve objections (see CCP § 2030.250(a)). Therefore, an unverified response containing both answers and objections is effective to preserve those objections. The lack of verification renders the fact-specific answers untimely; but that only creates a right to move for orders and sanctions (under § 2030.290(b); see ¶ 8:1136). It does not result in a waiver of the objections made. [See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 CA4th 651, 657, 46 CR2d 925, 928 (involving CCP § 2031.010 document requests)](b) [8:1114] Compare—may be used as impeachment: Even unverified answers can be used against the answering party—i.e., as a prior inconsistent statement to impeach the answering party’s testimony at trial. [Ev.C. §§ 1235, 1236; LeGrand v. Yellow Cab Co. (1970) 8 CA3d 125, 129, 87 CR 292, 294] g. [8:1115] Service of responses: The responding party must serve the original responses on the propounding party, with copies on all other parties who have appeared in the action. (If this is unduly burdensome, the court may grant ex parte relief limiting the parties to be served.) [CCP § 2030.260(c)]Note that the interrogatories and responses are not filed with the court. Custody of these documents is discussed at ¶ 8:1130. [8:1116 - 8:1117] Reserved. h. [8:1118] Amended responses: The responding party has no duty to amend earlier answers, but has the option to do so, as provided below (¶ 8:1119 ff.). [CCP §§ 2030.060(g), 2030.310(a)](1) [8:1119] No duty to amend: The responding party need only provide such information as is available at the time the answers are prepared. There is no duty to update or amend the answers, either to correct errors or to include new information discovered later. [Singer v. Sup.Ct. (Parr-Richmond Terminal Co.) (1960) 54 C2d 318, 325, 5 CR 697, 701; Biles v. Exxon Mobil Corp. (2004) 124 CA4th 1315, 1328, 22 CR3d 282, 291 (citing text)]Result: Earlier answers do not bar the responding party from introducing at trial, or in response to a summary judgment motion, evidence different from what was in the answer, subject to impeachment by the original answer, unless an intentionally false answer prejudiced a party (see ¶ 8:1247 ff., 8:2390 ff.).(a) [8:1120] Continuing interrogatories invalid: See discussion at ¶ 8:998.(b) [8:1121] Supplemental interrogatories available: See discussion at ¶ 8:942.[8:1122] Reserved.(2) [8:1123] Right to amend: A party wishing to amend answers to interrogatories, either to correct errors or omissions or to include subsequently-discovered facts, has the right to do so. Leave of court is not required. The amended answers can simply be served on the interrogating party and all others who received copies of the original answers. [CCP § 2030.310(a)]➪ [8:1124] PRACTICE POINTER: Often, the need to amend is discovered only after a motion is pending in which the answers are relevant (e.g., opposing party’s motion for summary judgment). In such a case, in addition to serving the amended answers on opposing parties, submit the amended answers to the court hearing the motion with a declaration explaining that the amended answers have been served.(a) [8:1125] Repudiated answer as impeachment: At trial, the interrogating party or any other party can use the original answer for impeachment (as a prior inconsistent statement), in the same manner as a changed response to a deposition question. [CCP § 2030.310(a); see Jahn v. Brickey (1985) 168 CA3d 399, 405, 214 CR 119, 123](b) [8:1125.1] Repudiated answers not binding as matter of law: Even if the amended answer contradicts the original answer, the responding party is not bound as a matter of law to the original answers. [Williams v. American Cas. Co. of Reading (1971) 6 C3d 266, 275, 98 CR 814, 820—D served “supplemental answers” in the middle of trial which repudiated earlier answers](c) [8:1126] Motion to hold repudiated answer binding: In lieu of simply using it for impeachment, the interrogating party may seek a court order holding the original answer binding on the responding party for purposes of the action. (A “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally must be shown.) [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2030.310(b)]In effect, this is a motion to preclude the use of the amended answer.The court may grant the motion if it finds:• The initial failure to answer the interrogatory correctly has substantially prejudiced the interrogating party; and• The responding party has failed to show substantial justification for the incorrect answer; and• The prejudice to the interrogating party cannot be cured by either a continuance to permit further discovery or use of the initial answer as impeachment. [CCP § 2030.310(c); see Gordon v. Sup.Ct. (U.Z. Mfg. Co.) (1984) 161 CA3d 157, 168, 207 CR 327, 333; People ex rel. Gov. Employees Ins. Co. v. Cruz (2016) 244 CA4th 1184, 1194-1195, 198 CR3d 566, 575-576—court erred in deeming responses binding where moving party failed to establish prejudice or that any prejudice could not be cured]1) [8:1127] Example: P sued Driver and Employer for personal injuries. Employer answered interrogatories stating Driver had been on errand for Employer at time of accident. Employer knew this was not true, but stated this in an effort to obtain coverage under Employer’s liability insurance. Relying on this answer (indicating Driver had been acting in course and scope of employment), P did not serve Driver personally. Later, the action was dismissed against Driver for delay in service of summons. Then, Employer amended the earlier answer to deny Driver was acting in course and scope of employment. Held: Since P could no longer proceed against Driver, Employer would not be permitted to change its earlier admission that Driver had been acting in course and scope of employment at time of accident. [Gordon v. Sup.Ct. (U.Z. Mfg. Co.), supra, 161 CA3d at 167-168, 207 CR at 333]2) [8:1127.1] Comment: Interrogatory responses (original and amended) are not preclusive in the way that admissions to requests for admission are—i.e., the responses usually may be contradicted at trial.(d) [8:1128] Sanctions: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party on the above motion (¶ 8:1126) unless it finds that party acted “with substantial justification” or other circumstances make sanctions “unjust.” [CCP § 2030.310(d)]The “substantial justification” standard is discussed at ¶ 8:1964 ff. i. [8:1129] Supplemental and further responses: “Supplemental responses” refer to responses to supplemental interrogatories (CCP § 2030.070, ¶ 8:942). “Further responses” means additional answers ordered by the court when the original responses are held inadequate—e.g., on a motion to compel (see ¶ 8:1145 ff.). © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[CCP §§ 2030.290, 2030.300] Note that the burden is on the propounding party to enforce discovery. Otherwise, no penalty attaches either for the responding party’s failure to respond or responding inadequately. [Saxena v. Goffney (2008) 159 CA4th 316, 334, 71 CR3d 469, 483 (citing text)] The same procedure—a motion to compel—is used to enforce discovery where parties from whom discovery is sought fail to respond at all or where they respond with objections or incomplete answers. But there are differences in the procedural requirements, as discussed below (¶ 8:1137 ff.). Cross-refer: The motion is governed by the rules and procedures governing motions generally; see Ch. 9 Part I. a. [8:1137] For FAILURE to respond: If a party to whom interrogatories were directed fails to serve a timely response, the propounding party may move for an order compelling responses and for a monetary sanction. [CCP § 2030.290(b); see Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants (2007) 148 CA4th 390, 404, 55 CR3d 751, 760 (citing text)]The motion to compel may be heard even if tardy responses are served after the motion is filed. Unless the propounding party takes the matter off calendar, the court may determine whether the responses are legally sufficient and award sanctions for the failure to respond on time. [Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 CA4th at 410-411, 55 CR3d at 765]Many courts will not rule on the adequacy of the responses filed before the hearing, because those issues have not been briefed, there is no separate statement as to those issues, and usually the parties have not met and conferred in an effort to reduce issues to be decided. Those courts still will decide the sanctions issues.(1) [8:1138] No time limit on motion: The statute (CCP § 2030.290) contains no time limit for a motion to compel where no responses have been served (i.e., no objections or answers of any kind). [Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 CA4th at 410-411, 55 CR3d at 765 (citing text)]➪ [8:1139] PRACTICE POINTER: You should act quickly even though there is no deadline. If you file a motion to compel initial answers, you then have to wait for the hearing and ultimately receive answers that may or may not be acceptable. In the meantime, your time for trial preparation is being lost.(2) [8:1140] Moving papers: All that need be shown in the moving papers is that a set of interrogatories was properly served on the opposing party, that the time to respond has expired, and that no response of any kind has been served. [See Leach v. Sup.Ct. (Markum) (1980) 111 CA3d 902, 905-906, 169 CR 42, 44] (No separate statement is required; see CRC 3.1345(b).)(a) [8:1140.1] Joinder of motions against several parties? Motions to compel compliance with separate discovery requests ordinarily should be filed separately. But they may be joined where the requests are so interrelated as to make separate motions wholly inefficient (e.g., where several defendants have all failed to answer the same set of interrogatories). However, local rules so providing appear to have been preempted by CRC 3.20(a); see ¶ 9:13.2.(3) [8:1141] No attempt to resolve informally required: The moving party is not required to show a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally with opposing counsel before filing the motion. [CCP § 2030.290; Sinaiko Healthcare Consulting, Inc. v. Pacific Healthcare Consultants, supra, 148 CA4th at 411, 55 CR3d at 766 (citing text); Leach v. Sup.Ct. (Markum), supra, 111 CA3d at 906, 169 CR at 44](a) [8:1142] Rationale: The failure to timely respond waives all objections to the interrogatories (¶ 8:1030); so there are no issues left to “resolve” with opposing counsel. [See Leach v. Sup.Ct. (Markum), supra, 111 CA3d at 906, 169 CR at 44]➪ [8:1143] PRACTICE POINTER: Even if not required, it is good practice before filing your motion to write a letter to opposing counsel, pointing out that you have not received responses to your interrogatories and stating your intent to file the motion. Your letter may induce your opponent to answer the interrogatories promptly, saving you the time and expense of the motion to compel answers. And, even if it does not, it will improve your chances of getting monetary sanctions at the hearing on the motion.(4) [8:1144] Monetary sanctions: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party on the motion to compel unless it finds that party acted “with substantial justification” or other circumstances render the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2030.290(c)] (See further discussion at ¶ 8:1921 ff.) b. [8:1145] For UNSATISFACTORY responses: A motion to compel also lies where the party to whom the interrogatories were directed gave responses deemed improper by the propounding party; e.g., objections, or evasive or incomplete answers. [CCP § 2030.300; see Best Products, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Granatelli Motorsports, Inc.) (2004) 119 CA4th 1181, 1189-1190, 15 CR3d 154, 160-161—motion to compel proper to challenge “boilerplate” responses](1) [8:1146] 45-day limit: In this situation, a notice of motion to compel must be served, if at all, within 45 days after verified responses, or any verified supplemental responses, were served (extended under CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, if served by mail, overnight delivery, fax or electronically; see ¶ 9:87 ff.), unless the parties agree in writing to extend the time. [CCP § 2030.300(c)]Thus, when verifications are provided electronically, the deadline for filing the motion is 45 calendar days plus 2 court days after service of verifications. [CCP § 1010.6(a)(3); Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 136-137, 300 CR3d 225, 232—motion filed 1 day late was untimely]Delaying the motion beyond the 45-day time limit waives the right to compel a further response to the interrogatories. [CCP § 2030.300(c); see Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Halpern) (1983) 147 CA3d 681, 685, 195 CR 295, 298—court lacks jurisdiction to order further answers after 45 days]➪ [8:1147] PRACTICE POINTER: This is a potential malpractice “trap.” Here are some suggestions:• First, make sure you and your client both review the opposing party’s responses to your interrogatories promptly upon receipt.• If the responses are not entirely satisfactory, calendar the date to remind yourself of the 45-day limit on a motion to compel.• If you decide to make the motion, do so promptly; and watch out for the “meet and confer” requirement (see ¶ 8:1158 ff.) that must be satisfied before you file the motion.(a) [8:1147.1] “Hybrid” responses with objections and answers: The 45-day clock begins only upon service of verified responses where the responses contain any substantive responses (more than just objections). [Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 135-136, 300 CR3d 225, 231-232—service of unverified responses which consisted of both substantive responses and objections did not trigger 45-day time limit to bring motion to compel even where motion challenged only objections]It is unclear if there is any deadline for bringing a motion to compel following service of only unverified objections. See ¶ 8:1150.7 ff.(b) [8:1148] Stipulations to extend time for motion: The parties may extend the 45-day limit on making a motion to compel by written agreement specifying a later date. [CCP § 2030.300(c)](c) [8:1149] Court order extending time? The Discovery Act omits an earlier statute that gave courts authority to extend the time for making a motion to compel. This “indicates an intention by the Legislature not to vest any authority in the court to permit discovery that is not timely made.” [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1409-1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712 (dictum)](d) [8:1150] Relief for untimely motions? There is no authority under the Discovery Act for relief for untimely motions to compel further responses to interrogatories.Relief for untimely motions may be available, however, under CCP § 473(b) based on “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” (see ¶ 5:282 ff.). CCP § 473(b) relief is available only where the Discovery Act contains no analogous provision for relief. [See Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1107, 1 CR2d 222, 228, discussed at ¶ 8:10.5 ff.]Note: The court in Sexton, supra, held the 45-day time limit on motions to compel was “jurisdictional.” However, the court did not discuss or consider whether relief for untimely motions was available under CCP § 473(b). [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1409-1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712][8:1150.1 - 8:1150.4] Reserved.(e) [8:1150.5] No “second chance” to ask same questions: The party who failed to meet the 45-day deadline cannot “reset the clock” by asking the same questions again in a later set of interrogatories. The failure waives the right to compel answers to those questions. [Professional Career Colleges, Magna Institute, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Stewart) (1989) 207 CA3d 490, 494, 255 CR 5, 7]➪ [8:1150.6] PRACTICE POINTER: Although you may not ask the same questions again in interrogatories, you may be able to use other discovery devices to obtain the information; e.g., depositions, RFAs, document production requests and subpoenas. [See Carter v. Sup.Ct. (CSAA Inter-Insurance Bureau) (1990) 218 CA3d 994, 997, 267 CR 290, 291-292 (discussed at ¶ 8:521)](f) [8:1150.7] Time limit applicable where only unverified objections received? CCP § 2030.300(c) states that the time limit for bringing a motion to compel further responses runs from the service of a verified response or supplemental verified response. It is not clear whether the statute’s 45-day period also applies to a response that is made up of only objections and therefore is not verified.• [8:1150.8] Comment: Before 2013, the statutes applicable to interrogatories (CCP § 2030.300(c)), requests for admission (CCP § 2033.290(c)) and inspection demands (CCP § 2031.310(c)) all provided that a motion to compel had to be brought within 45 days of service of the “response.” In 2013, the Legislature added the word “verified” to clarify that, where answers were served without verification but with a promise of service of verification in the future, the time for bringing the motion does not begin to accrue until verification is received. [See AB 1183, Sen. Jud. Comm. Bill Analysis (4/8/13)]However, a response with nothing other than objections does not need to be verified (see ¶ 8:1102) and is complete as of the date of service. Therefore, a court might take the position that the 45-day clock begins ticking as of the date of service of the unverified objections. [See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) 84 CA5th 127, 136, 300 CR3d 225, 231-232 & fn. 5 (leaving for another day answer to question whether time starts to run where unverified responses contain nothing but objections, but urging Legislature to address it)]Because this issue is not free from doubt, to be safe, you should serve your motion within 45 days of service of unverified objections.(2) [8:1150.9] Notice of motion: The notice of motion to compel “must state when, and the grounds upon which it will be made, and the papers, if any, upon which it is to be based.” [CCP §§ 1010, 2030.300(c); Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 137-139, 300 CR3d 225, 232-234—where notice alone was served, which failed to cite statutory authority for motion, failed to specify interrogatories at issue or state what was deficient about responses to interrogatories and failed to identify papers on which it was based, it did not “give notice” as required by statute, and fact that amended notice was filed “well ahead of the hearing” did not make notice effective; see ¶ 9:29 ff.](3) [8:1151] Separate statement of objections or disputed answers: A notice of motion for order compelling answers must be accompanied by a separate document setting forth the following information, unless the court permits the moving party to submit a concise outline of the matters in dispute (see ¶ 8:1157.3):• Each interrogatory (or other discovery request) to which further answer is sought, numbered and set forth verbatim;• The answer or objection made by the opposing party to each such discovery request, also verbatim;• The reason why further responses should be ordered by the court (i.e., the factual or legal reason why the objection is invalid or the answer given is incomplete);• If necessary, the text of all definitions, instructions and other matters required to understand each discovery request and the response to it;• Other discovery requests and responses if they are relevant to why further responses are necessary to the present discovery request; and• A summary of any pleadings or other documents on file by the party relying on them in the present discovery dispute. [CRC 3.1345(c)]➪ [8:1151.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Do not simply include this information in your notice of motion or points and authorities. Failure to include the separate statement required by CRC 3.1345 is ground for denial of your motion (unless the court allows a concise outline of issues; see ¶ 8:532.12, 8:1157.3 ff.).Don’t overlook the tactical advantage of your separate statement. This is the key document the court will look at before reviewing opposing papers. Therefore, it is the opportunity to state the argument for your client’s position succinctly and convincingly. Avoid generalities or reference back to arguments made in earlier papers.(a) [8:1152] Interrogatories and responses quoted verbatim: This is required because the interrogatories and answers are not on file with the court (¶ 8:1131); and there is no provision for “lodging” these documents with the court (¶ 8:1132). Similarly, if the interrogatories and responses are quoted verbatim, there is no need to append the discovery demands and responses to the attorney’s declaration filed with the motion papers.1) [8:1153] No incorporation by reference from other documents: If the answer to any particular interrogatory depends on the answer given to some other interrogatory, the other interrogatory and answer must be set forth verbatim as well. [CRC 3.1345(c)]Incorporation by reference is not allowed. [CRC 3.1345(c)]2) [8:1154] Grouped by subject matter: If the disputed responses are numerous, some courts may prefer to have them grouped by subject matter (e.g., all questions relating to the accident, or to damages, etc.); or, alternatively to have them indexed by stating the general subject matter and, immediately thereafter, the numbers of each question relating thereto. Other courts may prefer to have them in numerical order in the separate statement, but to be informed of the groupings in the memorandum of points and authorities.(b) [8:1155] Statement of reasons: The moving party must also include reasons why further answers should be ordered: legal or factual arguments why the answers given were incomplete or nonresponsive, or the objections invalid. [CRC 3.1345(c)]1) [8:1156] Pleadings or other discovery documents to be summarized: Pleadings, evidence or other discovery documents relevant to the motion must be summarized. They cannot simply be “incorporated into the separate statement by reference.” [CRC 3.1345(c)][8:1157] Reserved.(c) [8:1157.1] No other statements or summaries required: In the past, some courts required moving and responding parties to “merge” their separate statements into a single joint statement (containing the question, the response, the moving party’s reasons why further response is necessary, and the responding party’s reasons why it is not).However, this is not required by the CRC (and any such requirement under local rules is preempted by CRC 3.20).➪ [8:1157.2] PRACTICE POINTER: Even so, there is no reason why counsel cannot submit a joint statement voluntarily. (Counsel can exchange electronic files to facilitate its preparation.)The judge will appreciate the effort. It will be a lot easier to rule without having to flip through two large separate documents simultaneously.(d) [8:1157.3] Concise outline in lieu of separate statement: In lieu of a separate statement, the court may in its discretion allow the moving party to submit a concise outline of the discovery request and each response in dispute. [CCP § 2030.300(b)(2); CRC 3.1345(b)(2); see ¶ 8:532.12]➪ [8:1157.4] PRACTICE POINTER: Before filing your motion to compel, find out whether the court in which the matter is pending will accept a concise outline of the matters in dispute in lieu of a separate statement, either by contacting the court clerk or by raising the issue at an early case management conference in a case assigned to a judge for all purposes. If you file a concise outline and later learn that is not permitted by the judge, your motion may be denied and it may be too late for you to file a motion with a separate statement. On the other hand, if you are opposing the motion, object to the failure of the moving party to obtain court permission to file a concise outline, but also oppose the motion on the merits, because the court may address the motion on the merits even without a separate statement or prior court order permitting the concise outline (see ¶ 8:532.12).FORMS• Motion to Compel (Further) Answers to Interrogatories and for Sanctions and Proposed Order, see Form 8:19 in Rivera, Cal.

Before Trial FORMS (TRG).• Concise Outline of Interrogatories and Responses in Dispute, see Form 8:20.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(4) [8:1158] Attempt to resolve informally (“meet and confer”) requirement: The motion to compel must also be accompanied by a declaration stating facts showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally the issues presented by the motion before filing the motion. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2030.300(b)(1); Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 138, 300 CR3d 225, 233, fn. 9—declaration must accompany notice of motion, along with all other documents supporting notice of motion]Under the Discovery Act, it is clear that no in-person “meeting” is required.The attempt to resolve informally may be made either by conferring “in person, by telephone, or by letter with an opposing party or attorney.” [CCP § 2023.010(i) (emphasis added) (failure to make such attempt constitutes “misuse of discovery process”)]➪ [8:1158.1] PRACTICE POINTER: A face-to-face meeting, or at least a video conference, between counsel with authority to resolve the dispute is usually more effective than phone calls or emails. The fewer the issues the court must deal with, the more inclined it may be to resolve those issues. You are much less likely to be sent to the jury room to “work it out” before your motion is heard.➪ [8:1158.2] FURTHER PRACTICE POINTER—INFORMAL CONFERENCE PROCEDURE: Parties may seek, or courts may require, an informal discovery conference with the judge before a motion is filed. See discussion at ¶ 8:787.1.(a) [8:1159] Purpose: The purpose of the meet and confer requirement is to force lawyers to reexamine their positions, and to narrow their discovery disputes to the irreducible minimum, before calling upon the court to resolve the matter. It also enables parties and counsel to avoid sanctions that are likely to be imposed if the matter comes before the court. [Stewart v. Colonial Western Agency, Inc. (2001) 87 CA4th 1006, 1016, 105 CR2d 115, 121-122](b) [8:1160] Compare—not required where motion based on failure to respond: An “attempt to resolve informally” is not required where a party has failed to respond within the statutory time limit. Such failure waives all objections to the interrogatories (¶ 8:1142), so there are no “disputed issues” left to resolve. [See Leach v. Sup.Ct. (Markum) (1980) 111 CA3d 902, 906, 169 CR 42, 44](The party who failed to respond may seek relief from waiver after serving proposed responses in substantial compliance with the discovery request; see ¶ 8:1034.)(c) [8:1160.1] Caution—time trap: Efforts to “resolve informally” do NOT extend the 45-day limit within which the propounding party must move for further answers. [CCP § 2030.300(c); Vidal Sassoon, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Halpern) (1983) 147 CA3d 681, 683-684, 195 CR 295, 296-297; see ¶ 8:1146]➪ [8:1160.2] PRACTICE POINTERS: If the conferring process takes more than 45 days, it will be too late to file a motion to compel, unless you obtain a stipulation extending the time.If you anticipate your negotiations with opposing counsel may extend beyond the 45-day period, ask for an agreement at the outset, extending the time for filing a motion to compel. If opposing counsel refuses, you know at the outset that you have 45 days—and no more—within which to act. If you wait until the end of the 45-day period to request such agreement, opposing counsel may refuse and it may then be difficult or impossible to get your motion filed in time.(d) [8:1161] What constitutes “reasonable and good faith attempt”: The moving party’s declaration must show a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues informally with opposing counsel. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2030.300(b); see Clement v. Alegre (2009) 177 CA4th 1277, 1294, 99 CR3d 791, 804—reasonable and good faith attempt at informal resolution entails something more than bickering with opposing counsel]1) [8:1161.1] Telephone or letter may suffice: The attempt need not be made in person; it may be by telephone or even by letter. [CCP § 2023.010(i)]2) [8:1162] Personal animosity no excuse: Instructing one’s paralegal to discuss the matter with opposing counsel, plus uncompleted telephone calls, have been held not a “reasonable” attempt to resolve disputed issues. The fact that the attorneys had a strong personal dislike for each other is no excuse. [Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Sup.Ct. (Golsch) (1981) 122 CA3d 326, 333-334, 175 CR 888, 892-893; see also Masimo Corp. v. The Vanderpool Law Firm (2024) 101 CA5th 902, 910-911, 320 CR3d 704, 711-713—failure to meet and confer was evident in uncivil, “condescending” email sent to opposing counsel; civility is ethical obligation and transgressors “will be called out and immortalized in the California Appellate Reports”]3) [8:1162.1] Factors considered: Various factors may be considered by the court in determining whether a party made a “reasonable” and “good faith” attempt to resolve the issue informally, including:• Size of case, complexity of discovery: Greater effort at informal resolution may be required in larger, more complex cases;• Previous relations with opposing counsel: The history of the litigation and the nature of the interaction between counsel;• Present dispute: The nature of the issues, and the type and scope of discovery requested;• Timing: Making the first attempt to meet and confer shortly before the filing deadline may lead to a finding that there was no good faith attempt to resolve the issues informally. Conversely, a delayed response to a meet and confer letter may lead to the same finding as to the responding party;• Prospects for success: Whether, from the perspective of a reasonable person in the position of the discovering party, additional effort appeared likely to bear fruit;• Evidence of discovery abuse? When discovery requests are grossly overbroad on their face, and hence do not appear reasonably related to a legitimate discovery need, a reasonable inference can be drawn of an intent to harass and improperly burden. [Obregon v. Sup.Ct. (Cimm’s, Inc.) (1998) 67 CA4th 424, 431, 79 CR2d 62, 66-67; Marriage of Moore (2024) 102 CA5th 1275, 1293-1296, 322 CR3d 249, 265-267][8:1162.2 - 8:1162.4] Reserved.4) Application• [8:1162.5] P’s lack of a “good faith” effort at informal resolution was shown by the following:— P propounded grossly overbroad interrogatories (suggesting improper motives);— Upon receiving D’s objections, P sent a single brief letter, late in the relevant time period, requesting informal resolution; and— P’s motion to compel made no effort to explain why interrogatories of such breadth were proper. [Obregon v. Sup.Ct. (Cimm’s, Inc.), supra, 67 CA4th at 432-433, 79 CR2d at 67]➪ [8:1163] PRACTICE POINTERS RE “REASONABLE ATTEMPT”: The following should satisfy the “reasonable attempt” requirement. They should also help position you to obtain monetary sanctions if your motion to compel is granted; or, if you lose, to resist sanctions on the basis that there was “substantial justification” for your motion.• First, send a letter: Your letter should be a “script” for the arguments you plan to make on the motion. For each item in dispute, describe the deficiencies in the responses, and cite the authorities which establish your right to discovery. (If an issue of law is involved, it is a good idea to attach copies of the cases you are relying on.)If the dispute is not resolved, this letter should be included as an exhibit to your declaration in support of your motion to show your “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues. With this in mind, keep the tone of your letter amicable. Demonstrate willingness to negotiate and to avoid unnecessary court hearings. Avoid insults or the appearance of petty bickering with opposing counsel. • Ask for an agreement waiving the deadline on a motion to compel: As stated above (¶ 8:1160.1), efforts to “resolve informally” do not extend the 45-day deadline for filing a motion to compel. Thus, ask for an agreement at the outset to eliminate this as a problem later on, and send a letter or email confirming the agreement. However, be careful about extending deadlines too far out as you may need time to follow up.• Follow up with telephone call, video conference, or personal meeting: Where there are numerous items in dispute or the matter is complicated, a mere exchange of letters is not likely to resolve anything. A “reasonable and good faith” attempt may require you to seek a meeting or telephone conference with opposing counsel. Face-to-face meetings are usually more productive than telephone conferences (due to interruptions, lack of preparation, etc.). You can use your letter as the agenda for the meeting.• Be prepared to give and take: Allowing opposing counsel to “score some points” usually improves your chances to resolve the dispute. So, be willing to capitulate on less important items in order to obtain discovery on the more important. A good faith effort to resolve the dispute will enhance your position if a motion becomes necessary.• Offer a compromise: If there is a middle ground and one party offers a compromise while the other maintains an all-or-nothing position, the court may adopt the compromise as being more reasonable. Even if you don’t get your compromise, the court may find that you acted with substantial justification and not assess sanctions.• Follow up with confirming letter: Immediately following the telephone conference or meeting, send a letter to opposing counsel stating which items in your original letter have been resolved and which have not; and if further responses have been promised, the date on which they are due. Without such a follow-up letter, your opponent may deny whatever agreements were reached. If the case goes to court, the law and motion judge will never know for sure who to believe (impairing your chances for obtaining sanctions).• Provide a detailed declaration on your motion to compel: Your declaration should contain each fact essential to the court’s understanding of your motion and request for sanctions. As an added benefit, the declaration does not count toward the 15-page limit on points and authorities.[8:1164 - 8:1173] Reserved.(e) [8:1174] Sanctions for failure to make reasonable attempt to resolve informally: Failing to make a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues informally before a motion to compel is filed constitutes a “misuse of the discovery process.” Monetary sanctions can be imposed against whichever party is guilty of such conduct, even if that party wins the motion to compel. [CCP §§ 2023.010(i), 2023.020; see detailed discussion at ¶ 8:2100 ff.][8:1175 - 8:1178] Reserved.(5) [8:1179] Burden on responding party to justify objections: If a timely motion to compel has been filed, the burden is on the responding party to justify any objection or failure fully to answer the interrogatories. [Coy v. Sup.Ct. (Wolcher) (1962) 58 C2d 210, 220-221, 23 CR 393, 398; Fairmont Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Stendell) (2000) 22 C4th 245, 255, 92 CR2d 70, 77]➪ [8:1179.1] PRACTICE POINTERS: If you represent the responding party, you need to prepare and file declarations and/or points and authorities. It is your job to explain clearly the grounds for each objection or failure to answer fully. (If you lose the motion, the court will impose monetary sanctions unless you show “substantial justification” for your client’s position or circumstances making sanctions “unjust.”)Make sure your declarations include admissible evidence of the facts on which your objection was based (i.e., no “information and belief” allegations). If your objection is based on other discovery documents or pleadings, they should be attached or quoted verbatim.Remember that your opposing declarations and points and authorities must be served and filed with the court at least 9 court days before the hearing on the motion. [CCP § 1005(b)]If you believe there is no substantial justification for the motion, include a request for monetary sanctions against the moving party.Your request for sanctions should contain a notice provision clearly stating against whom you are seeking sanctions—opposing party, or counsel, or both (¶ 8:1980 ff.). And it must be supported by factual declarations showing the amount of sanctions sought (CCP § 2023.040, ¶ 8:2002).Even if you end up losing, the stronger your showing, the less likelihood of sanctions being awarded against you: i.e., by showing there was room for a legitimate difference of opinion as to discoverability, you establish “substantial justification” for your client’s position (see ¶ 8:1964).(6) [8:1180] Ruling on motion to compel further answers: The granting or denial of a motion to compel rests within the court’s sound discretion.(a) [8:1181] Factors considered: The ruling usually is based on consideration of the following factors:• The relationship of the information sought to the issues framed in the pleadings;• The likelihood that disclosure will be of practical benefit to the party seeking discovery;• The burden or expense likely to be encountered by the responding party in furnishing the information sought. [Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Rolfe) (1968) 263 CA2d 12, 19, 69 CR 348, 352](b) [8:1182] Each objection should be considered: But it is not an abuse of discretion to fully deny a motion to compel if objections that the discovery sought information outside the permissible scope of discovery were valid. [Deaile v. General Tel. Co. of Calif. (1974) 40 CA3d 841, 851, 115 CR 582, 588](7) [8:1183] Appointment of referee: Where the motion is voluminous and complex, some courts may refer the dispute to a court commissioner, if available. If not, the court has the power to appoint a referee to hear and determine “any and all discovery motions and disputes relevant to discovery” (CCP § 639(a)(5)). The power of the court to appoint discovery referees is limited by very specific requirements. See discussion at ¶ 8:1803 ff.➪ [8:1183.1] PRACTICE POINTER: There are pros and cons involved in using a discovery referee. On the positive side, it is likely easier to arrange for time and special briefing schedules before referees and to set longer periods for the hearings. A referee is likely to have more time to dig into the facts and attend to a long series of items. If there are many discovery disputes, the referee can provide continuity in a way the trial judge (who may be handling hundreds of cases) cannot.On the other hand, some discovery referees may set aside exorbitant amounts of time for prehearing document review and the hearing itself, substantially increasing costs. Referee rulings are generally reviewable by the trial judge, causing delay and increased costs as a second hearing on the same issue must be briefed and heard. Some judges discourage the use of referees because discovery disputes may be an important vehicle for case management.Usually, parties should not use a referee unless court-ordered and unless they are generally willing to follow the referee’s rulings (to avoid wasting time and judicial resources in having the rulings reviewed). Consider alternative procedures wherever possible. See discussion at ¶ 8:787.1. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt.

[8:1262] “Cut-off” at end of suitRFAs may be served any time during the lawsuit, subject to the following limitations: a. [8:1261] “Hold” on plaintiff’s discovery at outset: As with interrogatories (¶ 8:906), plaintiff is barred from serving RFAs without leave of court during the first 10 days after service of summons on the defendant or defendant’s appearance in the action. The court may grant leave to serve RFAs at an earlier time based on a showing of “good cause.” [CCP § 2033.020(b), (d)]This does not bar defendant from serving RFAs during this period. [CCP § 2033.020(a)][8:1261.1] Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, the “hold” on plaintiff’s discovery is only 5 days. [CCP § 2033.020(c)] b. [8:1262] “Cut-off” at end of suit: As with depositions and interrogatories, there is a “cut-off” on the RFA process as the case approaches trial:• A 30-day before the initial trial date deadline on “completing” discovery (meaning responses must be due by that date); and• A 15-day before the initial trial date deadline on the right to have motions concerning RFAs heard.

[8:1302] Serving RFAsThe following rules govern the form, content and number of RFAs that may be served: a. [8:1266] Official Form: The Judicial Council has been directed to “develop and approve official form … requests for admission” for use in the most common civil actions: personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, breach of contract, fraud, unlawful detainer and family law. Use of this form is strictly optional and does not preclude serving different or additional requests. [CCP § 2033.710 et seq.]So far, the Judicial Council has approved only a skeleton form Request for Admissions. It is not tailored to any particular type of action. (Comment: As a practical matter, it is questionable whether meaningful RFAs can be devised on an “official form” basis.)FORM: Request for Admissions (optional Judicial Council form DISC-020), see Form 8:22 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). b. [8:1267] Number of requests: The number of RFAs permitted depends on the type of admission requested:(1) [8:1268] NO limit on RFAs re genuineness of documents: There is no limit on the number of requests that can be made relating to the genuineness of documents. [CCP § 2033.030(a)] (Protective orders are available for excessive requests; see ¶ 8:1303.)(2) [8:1269] “Rule of 35 PLUS” as to other requests: As to matters other than the genuineness of documents, however, the “Rule of 35 PLUS” applies: A party has the right to serve up to 35 requests on each other party. These can be served in one or several sets. [CCP § 2033.030(a)]Unlike interrogatories, Official Form RFAs do count against the 35 limit. (Another reason they are not likely to be used.) [CCP § 2033.030](a) [8:1269.1] Separate limit for each party: A separate 35 RFAs may be served by each coparty and to each opposing party. See ¶ 8:937 ff.(b) [8:1269.2] Effect of exceeding limit: Unless a “declaration of necessity” is attached (¶ 8:1270 ff.), the responding party must answer the first 35 RFAs (no picking and choosing the easiest questions). An objection can be stated to the balance. [CCP § 2033.030(b); see ¶ 8:939 ff.](c) [8:1270] “Declaration of necessity” for additional RFAs: If more than 35 RFAs (not relating to genuineness of documents) are sought, the propounding party must serve a “declaration of necessity.” [CCP § 2033.030(b)]1) [8:1270.1] Ground: The sole ground for such declaration is that the excess RFAs are justified by the “complexity or the quantity of the existing and potential issues in the particular case.” [CCP § 2033.040(a) (emphasis added)](Compare—interrogatories: Excess interrogatories are authorized also on grounds of “financial burden” or “expedience”; see ¶ 8:949.1. But these grounds do not apply to RFAs.)2) [8:1271] Form and content: Except for the statement of grounds (¶ 8:1270.1), the form and content of the “Declaration for Additional Discovery” is the same as discussed in connection with interrogatories, at ¶ 8:949 ff.3) [8:1271.1] How challenged: The responding party may challenge the “declaration of necessity” by motion for protective order, on the ground the number of RFAs is unwarranted. [CCP § 2033.040(a)]Such motion places the burden on the propounding party to justify the number of RFAs served. [CCP § 2033.040(b); see ¶ 8:955] c. [8:1272] Format of RFAs: The requests must comply with the following rules:(1) [8:1273] Separate from other discovery methods: RFAs must be set forth in a separate document. They may not be combined “in a single document” with interrogatories or any other discovery method. [CCP § 2033.060(h)][8:1274] Reserved.➪ [8:1275] PRACTICE POINTER: Although RFAs and interrogatories may not be combined in the same document, it is still good practice to serve interrogatories coordinated with RFAs (see ¶ 8:965).(2) [8:1276] Opening paragraph: The first paragraph immediately below the title of the case must show:• The identity of the party requesting admissions;• The set number (each set to be numbered consecutively); and• The identity of the party to whom the requests are directed. [CCP § 2033.060(a), (b)](a) [8:1277] Example: “PLAINTIFF JOHN SMITH’S SECOND SET OF REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS TO DEFENDANT HARRY BROWN”(3) [8:1278] Question numbering: Each RFA must be identified by letter or number. [CCP § 2033.060(c)]➪ [8:1278.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Although there is no requirement that RFAs be numbered consecutively from set to set, doing so is a good idea. For example, if the first set contained Requests 1-10, start the second set with Request 11.FORM: Attorney-Drafted Requests for Admissions, see Form 8:23 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).[8:1279 - 8:1280] Reserved. d. [8:1281] Each request separate and complete: Each RFA shall be “separately set forth” and shall be “full and complete in and of itself.” [CCP § 2033.060(c)-(d)](1) [8:1282] No subparts: See discussion in connection with interrogatories, ¶ 8:974 ff. [CCP § 2033.060(f)](2) [8:1283] No “compound, conjunctive or disjunctive” requests: See discussion of “and/or” questions in connection with interrogatories, ¶ 8:978 ff. [CCP § 2033.060(f)](3) [8:1284] No preface or instructions: See discussion in connection with interrogatories, ¶ 8:967 ff. [CCP § 2033.060(d)](4) [8:1285] Specially defined terms: Any term with a special definition must be typed in CAPITAL LETTERS whenever the term appears. See discussion in connection with interrogatories, ¶ 8:970 ff. [CCP § 2033.060(e)](5) [8:1286] Documents attached: If the request is for admission of genuineness of documents, copies of the documents must be attached to the request. [CCP § 2033.060(g)](a) [8:1287] Originals to be available for inspection: The requesting party must also make the originals available for inspection by the party to whom the requests are directed. [CCP § 2033.060(g)]Comment: Of course, this would not apply where the original is held by the responding party or some third party. But counsel should establish this by interrogatories or other discovery device before seeking admission of the document’s genuineness. ➪ [8:1287.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Keep your RFAs as simple as possible so there will be no room for denial or evasion. This will avoid objections on the ground of “compound and conjunctive” (¶ 8:1283). (It may run up the number of RFAs you need to serve, but you can use a “declaration of necessity” for more than 35 requests if need be; ¶ 8:1270 ff.)Keep in mind that any admission obtained will probably be construed narrowly (see ¶ 8:1390.2). So, make sure there is no room for quibbling as to what was admitted.For example, instead of asking:“You are requested to admit that …“5. Defendant Mary Smith was driving an automobile registered to defendant John Jones in the course and scope of her employment by John Jones at the time of the accident” … Ask the following separate RFAs:“You are requested to admit that …”6. Defendant Mary Smith was operating a … (year) Buick, California License No. 3B77024, at the time and place of the accident described in the complaint.“7. The automobile was registered at the time of the accident to defendant John Jones.“8. Defendant Mary Smith was an employee of defendant John Jones at the time of the accident.“9. Defendant Mary Smith was performing acts within the course and scope of her employment by Jones at the time and place of the accident.”  e. [8:1288] Content of request: RFAs may be used as to any matter within the permissible scope of discovery: i.e., “relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending action” (CCP § 2017.010, ¶ 8:66 ff.); and not otherwise privileged or protected from discovery. [CCP § 2033.010](1) [8:1289] Genuineness of documents: RFAs are commonly used to establish the genuineness of specified documents. [See CCP § 2033.010](2) [8:1290] Factual matters: Likewise, RFAs are commonly used to establish the truth of specified facts: e.g., due execution of documents; ownership of vehicles; dates of transactions, etc. [CCP § 2033.010](a) [8:1291] To obtain discovery of facts: The Discovery Act expressly authorizes use of RFAs for discovery purposes rather than merely to obtain admissions. [CCP § 2019.010(e); see ¶ 8:1256]1) [8:1292] Thus, properly worded RFAs may force the opposing party to disclose evidence. For example:“You are requested to admit that …— “Your vehicle was travelling at 65 miles per hour immediately prior to the impact”;— “Witness Jones is the only person known by you to have observed the accident other than the parties to this action”; or— “You presently have no knowledge of any fact to support the allegations in Paragraph … of your complaint.” ➪ [8:1293] PRACTICE POINTER: Use such requests. Reason: If denied, they may set the stage for shifting of costs and expenses of proof for failure to admit.They can also be used as the foundation for a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. I.e., the opponent’s admissions that it has no evidence on a particular point may satisfy your burden of proof on a summary judgment motion to show no triable issue of fact (see ¶ 10:223, 10:242).Finally, such admissions could expose the opponent to sanctions (including terminating sanctions) under CCP § 128.7 for asserting a claim or defense without evidentiary support (see ¶ 9:1135).➪ [8:1293.1] FURTHER PRACTICE POINTER: There is even an advantage to propounding RFAs you expect will be denied. If you serve RFAs simultaneously with Form Interrogatories—General (optional Judicial Council form DISC-001), you can use “Interrogatory 17.1” which, in effect, provides 35 additional contention interrogatories that are not included in the limit of 35 “specially prepared” interrogatories (see ¶ 8:934.3). Other specialized interrogatories (e.g., for employment law (DISC-002)) contain a similar interrogatory to be served with RFAs.(3) [8:1294] Opinions: RFAs may properly be used to establish an “opinion relating to fact.” [CCP § 2033.010; Vargas v. Gallizzi (2023) 96 CA5th 362, 370, 314 CR3d 346, 353-354]• [8:1295] For example, parties may be required to admit or deny the value of property in dispute. “The fact that the request … calls for an opinion is of no moment.” [Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 430, 15 CR 127, 131]• [8:1296] Likewise, a party may be required to admit or deny that the contours of certain land “differed” from its original contours, and that there was a “greater probability” of landsliding than previously. [Chodos v. Sup.Ct. (Lowe) (1963) 215 CA2d 318, 321, 30 CR 303, 305]• [8:1296.1] Also, a party may be required to admit or deny that the boundary lines between plaintiffs’ and defendants’ property are “accurately described” in plaintiffs’ deed. [Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 CA4th 729, 750, 175 CR3d 650, 667](4) [8:1297] Matters in controversy: An RFA may properly relate to a matter that is in controversy between the parties. [CCP § 2033.010]Thus, P’s request that D admit that “D was driving in excess of the posted speed limit at time and place of accident” is proper. “The fact that the request is for the admission of a controversial matter … is of no moment.” [Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 429, 15 CR 127, 130]Indeed, requests may be served asking for matters which, if admitted or deemed true (by failure to respond), would result in the unconditional surrender of the party on whom they are served. E.g., “Admit you have absolutely no grounds to prosecute [or defend] this case.” [See Demyer v. Costa Mesa Mobile Home Estates (1995) 36 CA4th 393, 395-396, 42 CR2d 260, 261, fn. 8 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 983, 90 CR2d 260, 267, fn. 12); Universal Home Improvement, Inc. v. Robertson (2020) 51 CA5th 116, 128, 264 CR3d 686, 695—RFA “asked plaintiffs to admit that they had no claim”; Yoon v. CAM IX Trust (2021) 60 CA5th 388, 394, 274 CR3d 506, 511—RFAs on key issues in case]But some courts have concerns that using RFAs in this way essentially imposes “strict liability” in that a denial of a very broad RFA early in a case can lead to a request for costs of proof for the whole case. “That cannot be the law.” [Universal Home Improvement, Inc. v. Robertson (2020) 51 CA5th 116, 130-131, 264 CR3d 686, 697; Pappas v. Chang (2022) 75 CA5th 975, 994, 291 CR3d 106, 121]➪ [8:1298] PRACTICE POINTER: Requests of this type are usually not made with the expectation that an admission will be made. Rather, the purpose is to set the stage for use of form “Interrogatory 17.1” (¶ 8:1293.1) or a CCP § 2033.420 shifting of costs and expenses of proof (discussed at ¶ 8:1404 ff.), which is one of the unique advantages of this discovery tool.(5) [8:1299] Legal conclusions: An RFA may also require an “application of law to fact.” [CCP § 2033.010](a) [8:1300] Examples: Thus, a party may be required to admit or deny who is the “owner” of property; or whether the driver of a car had the owner’s “permission or consent”; or whether specified acts were “negligent”; or whether a third person was an “authorized agent” or was acting in the “course and scope of employment,” etc. [See Burke v. Sup.Ct. (Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland) (1969) 71 C2d 276, 280, 78 CR 481, 487—whether attachment levy was “regular on its face”; and Garcia v. Hyster Co. (1994) 28 CA4th 724, 735, 34 CR2d 283, 289—whether employer was “negligent” and whether such negligence was “legal cause” of P’s injuries](b) [8:1301] Purpose: Each of the foregoing involves some legal conclusion; e.g., “ownership” may depend on the validity of deeds, inheritance rights of third parties, etc.But if a party could not be forced to admit that another is the “owner” of property, or was “acting in the course and scope of employment,” these issues would have to go to trial. Forcing such admissions often leads to early dismissals or summary judgments.(c) [8:1301.1] Comment: This may pose problems if the responding party in good faith is unable to characterize the transaction as requested. E.g., a responding party can be subject to a shifting of costs and expenses of proof if the responding party wrongly refuses to admit “ownership” of property—even if the denial was based on subjective good faith interpretation of a deed, etc. (¶ 8:1408 ff.).➪ [8:1301.2] PRACTICE POINTER: If you represent the responding party in such a case, consider using a denial on the basis of inability to admit or deny, stating the reasons in detail (see ¶ 8:1341). It is unlikely that a shifting of costs and expenses of proof would be imposed under such circumstances unless there is no reasonable basis for the denial (¶ 8:1408 ff.). f. [8:1302] Serving RFAs: Copies of the RFAs must be served on the party to whom directed and all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2033.070](Only copies are served; the originals are retained by the requesting party, just as with interrogatories. See ¶ 8:1366.) © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[8:1365] Service of responsesh. [8:1366] Custody of originalsUnless excused by protective order (¶ 8:1303 ff.), the party to whom RFAs are directed is under a duty to respond thereto. The responses must be:• Timely (¶ 8:1308);• In the proper format (¶ 8:1315 ff.); and• Under oath (¶ 8:1360). [CCP §§ 2033.210-2033.250] a. [8:1308] Time limit for response: The responses are due within 30 days from the date the RFAs were served (extended for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically per CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013; see ¶ 9:87 ff.). [CCP §§ 2033.250, 2016.050]Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, responses are due within 5 days after service (unless the time is extended or shortened by court order). [CCP § 2033.250]If the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time limit is extended to the next court day closer to the trial date. [CCP § 2016.060](1) [8:1309] Court may extend or shorten time: The court has power to extend the time for response, on motion of the party to whom the RFAs are directed. (It also has power to shorten the period, on motion of the requesting party; but this is rarely done.) [CCP § 2033.250]• [8:1310] An extension apparently cannot be granted ex parte. A noticed motion is required for this purpose. (See discussion in connection with interrogatories, ¶ 8:1026.)Comment: The more complex the RFAs, the more likely a court will grant an extension. (The propounding party should keep this in mind and should be prepared to stipulate accordingly.)(2) [8:1311] Agreements extending time: Likewise, the propounding and responding parties may agree to extend the time for responses to some or all of the RFAs served. Where this occurs, it is the responding party’s obligation to notify all other parties to the action accordingly. [CCP § 2033.260(a), (d)](a) [8:1312] Written confirmation required: The agreement may be informal, but it must be confirmed in a writing (e.g., letter or email from one counsel to the other) that specifies the extended date for response. [CCP § 2033.260(b)](b) [8:1313] Includes right to object: Unless it expressly provides otherwise, an agreement extending time to “respond” reserves the right to object to any request. [CCP § 2033.260(c)](3) [8:1314] Effect of late response: The effect of delay or failure to respond to RFAs is discussed at ¶ 8:1367. b. [8:1314.1] Separate vs. joint response: The statute requires the party to whom RFAs have been directed to respond “separately” to each request. [CCP § 2033.210(a)]But where identical RFAs are served on coparties, they may properly respond in a single document provided each verifies the answers. To require a separate piece of paper from each coparty would exalt form over substance. [Tobin v. Oris (1992) 3 CA4th 814, 829, 4 CR2d 736, 745 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 90 CR2d 260)] c. Format of response(1) [8:1315] Opening paragraph: The first paragraph immediately below the title of the case must show:• The identity of the responding party;• The identity of the propounding party; and• The set number of the party’s requests being responded to (CCP § 2033.210(c)); and• If a further response, it must so state. [CRC 3.1000(a)](a) [8:1316] Example: “DEFENDANT TOM BROWN’S SUPPLEMENTAL RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF JANET SMITH’S REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS, SET NO. 2”[8:1317] Reserved.(2) [8:1318] Numbering: Each response (whether admission, denial or objection) shall bear the same number or letter as the RFA to which it pertains. [CCP § 2033.210(d)](3) [8:1319] Request need not be repeated: The text of the RFA need not be repeated in the response (except as may be required with electronic exchange of requests and responses, ¶ 8:1320). [CCP § 2033.210(d)](4) [8:1320] Electronic exchange of requests and responses: Upon request, a party must provide the document propounding RFAs in electronic format within three court days of the request. If this is provided, the responding party must include the text of the request preceding any response. Upon request, a party responding to the RFAs must provide the responses to the propounding party in an electronic format within three court days of the request. [CCP § 2033.210(e)(1), (2), (6)]FORM: Response to Requests for Admissions, see Form 8:24 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). d. [8:1321] Answers: The response must contain either an answer or an objection to the particular RFA. [CCP § 2033.210(b)]Each answer “shall be as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits.” [CCP § 2033.220(a) (emphasis added)]Thus, absent an objection (¶ 8:1349), the response must contain one of the following:• An admission;• A denial;• A statement claiming inability to admit or deny. [CCP § 2033.220(b)](Remember that all responses must be under oath; CCP § 2033.240(a), ¶ 8:1360.)(1) [8:1322] Admissions: If any portion of the RFA is true, the party to whom it is directed must admit that portion: “Each answer shall … [a]dmit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true, either as expressed in the request itself or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.” [CCP § 2033.220(b)(1)](a) [8:1323] Answering RFAs only partially correct: The answer must be “as complete and straightforward” as the information available reasonably permits and must “[a]dmit so much of the matter involved in the request as is true … or as reasonably and clearly qualified by the responding party.” [CCP § 2033.220(a), (b)(1) (emphasis added)]1) [8:1323.1] Example: An RFA asked plaintiff to “Admit you attended a meeting with [Party Y] on or about January 13, 2006.” She responded: “Admit. [Party X] was also present.” Plaintiff’s response “admitted the statement and was not improper.” [St. Mary v. Sup.Ct. (Schellenberg) (2014) 223 CA4th 762, 781, 167 CR3d 517, 532]2) [8:1323.2] Example: General Contractor served Subcontractor with RFAs that referred to a written contract between them requiring specified acts of performance by Subcontractor. Subcontractor admitted the matters described in the RFA, including the existence of a written contract. At trial, however, he sought to offer proof that there was no written contract. Subcontractor was bound by his admission that a written contract existed. [Valerio v. Andrew Youngquist Const. (2002) 103 CA4th 1264, 1271, 127 CR2d 436, 441]Comment: If Subcontractor wanted to preserve the issue, he should have admitted the truthfulness of the specified acts of performance but denied the portion of the RFA that referred to a written contract. [See CCP § 2033.220(a), (b)(1)]3) [8:1324] Comment: It is unclear whether a responding party must supply facts necessary to make an RFA true. For example:RFA asks Defendant to admit she was the “owner of the 2002 Honda California License No. 2ABC627 involved in the accident described in the complaint.”If Defendant’s car was a 2001 model (instead of 2002), she should answer by stating “Admitted, except that the car is a 2001 model, not 2002.”The harder question is whether she must volunteer facts not directly asked in the request; e.g., that she is not the sole “owner” and that a third party is a co-owner of the car? Future case law may flesh out the responding party’s obligations in this situation.(b) [8:1325] Evidentiary effect of admission: See ¶ 8:1387 ff.(c) [8:1326] Amending or withdrawing admission: See ¶ 8:1386 ff.[8:1327 - 8:1330] Reserved.(2) [8:1331] Denials: Alternatively, the responding party may “deny so much of the matter involved in the request as is untrue.” [CCP § 2033.220(b)(2)][8:1332] Comment: This must be read in conjunction with the requirement that the answer be “as complete and straightforward as the information reasonably available to the responding party permits” (CCP § 2033.220(a) (emphasis added)). The responding party should not deny based solely on quibbles with the wording of the request. It may be improper to deny an RFA outright if the request is at least partially true (¶ 8:1324).(a) [8:1332.1] Must be unequivocal: A denial of all or any portion of the request must be unequivocal. [See American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Calif. (2005) 126 CA4th 247, 268, 24 CR3d 285, 300 (citing text)]But reasonable qualifications and explanations are not improper (St. Mary v. Sup.Ct. (Schellenberg) (2014) 223 CA4th 762, 780-781, 167 CR3d 517, 532 (citing text)):• [8:1333] Denial “on advice of counsel” is unequivocal, “in spite of the rather weaseling qualification.” [Holguin v. Sup.Ct. (Hoage) (1972) 22 CA3d 812, 820, 99 CR 653, 657, fn. 9]• [8:1334] “As framed, denied” is also unequivocal. [Smith v. Circle P Ranch Co., Inc. (1978) 87 CA3d 267, 275, 150 CR 828, 833]• [8:1334.1] Denial following the “boilerplate” statement “without waiving these objections” was unequivocal, justifying cost-of-proof sanctions. [American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of Southern Calif., supra, 126 CA4th at 268, 24 CR3d at 300](b) [8:1335] Denials on “information and belief”: (Example: “D denies Request No. 3 based on information and belief that the matter stated is not true.”)• [8:1336] In the past at least, courts permitted this form of denial to RFAs. [Chodos v. Sup.Ct. (Lowe) (1963) 215 CA2d 318, 322, 30 CR 303, 305; and see Cohen v. Sup.Ct. (Gonzalez) (1976) 63 CA3d 184, 187, 133 CR 575, 577]• [8:1337] Whether the Discovery Act changes this rule is unclear. Arguably, a denial based “on information and belief” is not “straightforward” (as required by CCP § 2033.220(a), ¶ 8:1321) because no one knows what “information” the responding party was relying on.[8:1338 - 8:1339] Reserved.1) [8:1340] Compare—denials for LACK of information and belief: A denial based on lack of information and belief is, in effect, a sworn statement of inability to admit or deny. It is clearly proper provided it meets the requirements discussed below (¶ 8:1341 ff.).(3) [8:1341] Claimed inability to admit or deny; reasonable inquiry required: In lieu of admitting or denying the RFA, a party may respond by claiming inability (lack of sufficient information) to admit or deny the matter stated in the request. [CCP § 2033.220(c)]But a party responding in this manner must also state that a reasonable inquiry was made to obtain sufficient information: i.e., “a reasonable inquiry concerning the matter in the particular request has been made, and that the information known or readily obtainable is insufficient to enable that party to admit the matter.” [CCP § 2033.220(c) (emphasis added)]And where the evidence shows that responding parties did not have reasonable grounds for denial based on asserted lack of information, costs of proof sanctions are proper. [Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Macias (2021) 63 CA5th 1007, 1028-1029, 278 CR3d 487, 506-507 (see ¶ 8:1404.1)](a) [8:1342] Reasonable inquiry from available sources: The Discovery Act thus requires the responding party to undertake a “good faith” obligation to investigate sources reasonably available to the responding party in formulating answers to RFAs (similar to the duty owed in responding to interrogatories; ¶ 8:1054). [CCP § 2033.220(c); see Chodos v. Sup.Ct. (Lowe) (1963) 215 CA2d 318, 322, 30 CR 303, 305; Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs v. Macias (2021) 63 CA5th 1007, 1029, 278 CR3d 487, 506-507](b) Application• [8:1343] Information known to a party’s attorney or expert witnesses is deemed “obtainable” by the party. Therefore, responses to RFAs must be made in light of such information. [Chodos v. Sup.Ct. (Lowe), supra, 215 CA2d at 323-324, 30 CR at 305-306—improper to deny RFA claiming lack of personal knowledge, where party’s expert witness had the information; Bloxham v. Saldinger (2014) 228 CA4th 729, 752, 175 CR3d 650, 667—party may not necessarily avoid responding to RFA on ground it “calls for expert opinion and the party does not know the answer”]• [8:1344] But only a “reasonable” effort to find out is required. Thus, for example, a party would not be expected to travel to a foreign country to verify a street address there (or even hire a private investigator to do so). [Lindgren v. Sup.Ct. (Lindgren) (1965) 237 CA2d 743, 746, 47 CR 298, 299—request asked party to admit “there was no Hotel Legunitas in Madrid, Spain”]• [8:1344.1] Parties are often requested to admit the genuineness of the propounding party’s own documents and records (whether prepared by the propounding party or someone else). E.g., P serves D with RFAs to admit “the attached copies of my bank statements and payroll stubs are genuine.”[8:1344.2] Comment: There is no known authority on point, but arguably D may properly deny such requests on the ground D has no “reasonable” way of verifying the genuineness of P’s records.➪ [8:1344.3] PRACTICE POINTER: In most cases, you don’t need admissions as to the genuineness of your own records. Their contents can be proved by any otherwise admissible secondary evidence (e.g., photocopies) unless a genuine dispute exists concerning material terms, or admission of secondary evidence would be “unfair.” [See Ev.C. § 1521]However, obtaining early concessions on the genuineness of your documents may obviate the need for declarations on motion practice and also may save you time at trial.(c) [8:1345] Effect of hearsay information? It is not clear whether a party can properly claim “inability to admit or deny” where hearsay information is available. (Example: RFA asks party to admit Third Party received notice of some condition. Third Party acknowledges the notice.)1) [8:1346] Comment: Arguably, a party should be permitted to use the “inability to admit or deny” response even if the Third Party acknowledges the notice. I.e., the responding party should not be required to make binding admissions on the basis of hearsay; nor should the responding party be subject to shifting of costs and expenses of proof for denying it. However, as stated, the matter is unclear.➪ [8:1347] PRACTICE POINTER: To be safe, your response should make reference to whatever hearsay has been obtained. For example: “Other than statements or reports from … , the truth or falsity of which is unknown, Party has no knowledge or information sufficient to admit or deny Request No. … A reasonable inquiry concerning this matter has been made, and the only information known or readily obtainable concerning this matter is the hearsay evidence referred to above.”(d) [8:1348] Effect of failing to make “reasonable” investigation: The responding party’s simple statement that the responding party has made a “reasonable” inquiry and is unable to admit or deny the request because insufficient information is available may not suffice as an answer to the RFA. The propounding party may move to compel a proper response or to have the matter ordered admitted if the responding party has not made a reasonable inquiry or has access to “readily available” information that would enable the party to admit or deny the matter. [See Asea, Inc. v. Southern Pac. Transp. Co. (9th Cir. 1981) 669 F2d 1242, 1245-1246 (decided under analogous FRCP rule)]1) [8:1348.1] Shifting of costs and expenses of proof: Alternatively, costs and expenses of proof may be awarded after trial against a party for failure to investigate before answering (CCP § 2033.420; ¶ 8:1404 ff.). The court may find there was no “good reason” for the failure to admit. [Smith v. Circle P Ranch Co., Inc. (1978) 87 CA3d 267, 276, 150 CR 828, 834—proof that responding party failed to investigate, when the means of obtaining the information were at hand, supports finding there were no “good reasons” for its denial] e. [8:1349] Objections: In lieu of admitting or denying the RFA, the party may serve objections to particular requests. [CCP § 2033.210(b)]If only part of a request is objectionable, the remainder must be answered. [CCP § 2033.230(a)](1) [8:1350] Form: The specific ground for objection must be set forth clearly in the response (including claims of privilege and work product protection). [CCP § 2033.230(b)](2) [8:1351] Proper objections: Basically, the same objections available in response to interrogatories (¶ 8:1071 ff.) are available in response to RFAs:(a) [8:1352] Improper form: This objection would lie where the RFA is not “full and complete in and of itself,” or contains:• Subparts; or• Compound, conjunctive or disjunctive requests; or• A preface or instructions; or• A requirement that reference must be made to other documents in order to respond. [CCP § 2033.060(d), (f); see ¶ 8:979.5, 8:1281 ff.](b) [8:1353] Excessive number: Absent a “declaration of necessity” under CCP § 2033.050, an objection lies to more than 35 RFAs that do not pertain to genuineness of documents. [CCP § 2033.030(a)]• [8:1353.1] However, if a “declaration of necessity” accompanies the RFAs, then any challenge to the number served must be by motion for protective order. The motion effectively controverts the statement of grounds in the declaration, and places the burden on the propounding party to prove the excessive number of requests is warranted by the complexity of the case. [CCP § 2033.040(b), discussed at ¶ 8:1270](c) [8:1354] “Irrelevant”: An objection may also lie on the ground that the request is “irrelevant to the subject matter of the action”—the basic limitation on scope of permissible discovery (¶ 8:66). [Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 428, 15 CR 127, 130](d) [8:1355] “Burdensome and oppressive”: This ground for objection might be applicable, for example, to requests that are unduly repetitive, or where preparing the responses would somehow impose an “unjust burden” on the responding party. [Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 428, 15 CR 127, 130 (involving “shotgun variety” RFAs, consisting of numerous subparts, no longer permissible)]1) [8:1355.1] Excessive number alone not ground: A “burdensome and oppressive” objection probably does not lie solely because of the number of questions asked. The Discovery Act provides the procedure to challenge excessive numbers (see ¶ 8:1353).(3) Improper objections(a) [8:1356] Absent some defect in timing or service of the RFAs, objecting to the entire set of RFAs, without some attempt to admit or deny in part, cannot be considered a “good faith” response to RFAs. Such wholesale objections may result in imposition of sanctions against the responding party (¶ 8:1400 ff.). [Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 430, 15 CR 127, 131](b) [8:1357] It is not ground for objection that the request calls for an “opinion” (¶ 8:1294), or that the facts are known to the propounder of the requests. [Hillman v. Stults (1968) 263 CA2d 848, 885, 70 CR 295, 317](c) [8:1358] Nor is it ground for objection that the request is “ambiguous,” unless it is so ambiguous that the responding party cannot in good faith frame an intelligent reply. [See Cembrook v. Sup.Ct. (Sterling Drug, Inc.) (1961) 56 C2d 423, 428-429, 15 CR 127, 130-131]➪ [8:1359] PRACTICE POINTER: If you decide to object on ground that the request is “too ambiguous to frame a response,” include a brief explanation of what you feel is ambiguous and why it prevents any intelligent reply. f. [8:1360] Signature and verification of responses: The party to whom the RFAs were directed must sign the response under oath. That party’s attorney must also sign a response that contains an objection. If the response consists entirely of objections, then only the attorney’s signature is necessary. [CCP § 2033.240(a), (c)]If the response contains both answers and objections, there is no need to verify that portion containing the objections. [Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 CA4th 651, 657, 46 CR2d 925, 928](1) [8:1361] Form of verification: As with interrogatories, the common practice is for the responding party to sign a separate verification form attached to the responses (e.g., “I have read the foregoing Responses and know the contents thereof and certify that the same are true of my own knowledge”).(2) [8:1361.1] Verification by “Doe” sufficient: Where plaintiff files an action under a fictitious name to preserve anonymity (¶ 2:136.5 ff.), plaintiff may verify discovery responses by signing the fictitious name. [Doe v. Sup.Ct. (Luster) (2011) 194 CA4th 750, 756, 123 CR3d 557, 561—trial court erred in requiring plaintiff to provide verifications in her true name](3) [8:1362] Problems with corporate verification: The issues discussed in connection with verification of responses to interrogatories by a partnership, corporation or other entity apply as well here:• May the officer designated to make the verification on behalf of the entity use the “information and belief” form where the officer does not have personal knowledge of all matters in the response (see ¶ 8:1106)?• Is the officer’s statement that the officer is “authorized” to verify on behalf of the entity sufficient to establish such authority (see ¶ 8:1107)?(4) [8:1363] Attorney verification improper: Responses to RFAs must be verified by the responding party, not by counsel. The fact the party resides in another county may allow counsel to verify pleadings on the party’s behalf (see CCP § 446, ¶ 6:320); but that does not apply to responses to RFAs. [Steele v. Totah (1986) 180 CA3d 545, 550, 225 CR 635, 637; Brigante v. Huang (1993) 20 CA4th 1569, 1574-1575, 25 CR2d 354, 357 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 983, 90 CR2d 260, 267, fn. 12)—attorney who erroneously verifies RFAs may be deposed: attorney-client and work product privileges may have been waived](a) [8:1364] Compare—attorney as agent of entity: A corporation, partnership or other entity may appoint its attorney as its agent to verify responses; but this effectively waives any attorney-client or work product privilege as to the sources of the attorney’s information. [CCP § 2033.240(b)]Cross-refer: See further discussion in connection with interrogatories at ¶ 8:1109 ff.(5) [8:1364.1] Effect of unverified response: Where a verification is required (see ¶ 8:1360), an unverified response is ineffective; it is the equivalent of no response at all. [See Appleton v. Sup.Ct. (Cook) (1988) 206 CA3d 632, 636, 253 CR 762, 764; Allen-Pacific, Ltd. v. Sup.Ct. (Chan) (1997) 57 CA4th 1546, 1550-1551, 67 CR2d 804, 807 (disapproved on other grounds by Wilcox v. Birtwhistle (1999) 21 C4th 973, 983, 90 CR2d 260, 267, fn. 12)](a) [8:1364.2] Compare—responses containing both answers and objections: But no verification is required to preserve objections (see CCP § 2033.240(a)). Therefore, an unverified response containing both answers and objections is effective to preserve those objections. The lack of verification renders the fact-specific answers untimely; but that only creates a right to move for orders and sanctions (under § 2033.280; see ¶ 8:1378). It does not result in a waiver of the objections made. [See Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 CA4th 651, 657, 46 CR2d 925, 928 (involving CCP § 2031.010 et seq. document requests)] g. [8:1365] Service of responses: The responding party serves the original response on the requesting party. Copies of the response must be served on all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2033.250] h. [8:1366] Custody of originals: The requesting party ends up with the originals of both the requests and the responses, and must retain them until six months after final disposition of the action. [CCP § 2033.270(b)]These are not filed or lodged with the court, unless the court so orders.

[8:1379] Compare—cannot be used to force admissions of facts denied: No further response can be ordered to an RFA that has been unqualifiedly denied, even if the facts involved are unquestionably true. “[A] court [cannot] force a litigant to admit any particular fact if he is willing to risk a perjury prosecution or financial sanctions” by denying them. [Holguin v. Sup.Ct. (Hoage) (1972) 22 CA3d 812, 820, 99 CR 653, 658](1) [8:1380] Thus, for example, the responding party’s denial of matters the party had already admitted on deposition, or in answers to interrogatories, is not ground for a motion to compel further answers. However, the denial may entitle the requesting party to be reimbursed for the cost of proof of the denied fact, after trial (see ¶ 8:1404 ff.).➪ [8:1381] PRACTICE POINTER: A proper procedure in such a case is to serve interrogatories on the responding party asking the party to state the facts upon which the denials are based (¶ 8:1275). b. [8:1382] Procedure: The procedural requirements on a motion to compel are the same as those discussed previously in connection with interrogatories (see ¶ 8:1145).(1) [8:1383] 45-day time limit: The motion must be made within 45 days after service of verified responses in question, or any verified supplemental responses (longer if responses served by mail, overnight delivery, fax, or electronically; see CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, ¶ 9:87 ff.). Otherwise, the right to compel further responses is waived. [CCP §§ 2033.290(c), 2016.050]Comment: This 45-day time limit running from service of “verified” responses is the same statutory language as for the 45-day time limit to bring a motion to compel responses to interrogatories (see CCP § 2030.300(c); ¶ 8:1146 ff.). Where the responding party serves hybrid substantive responses and objections to requests for admission, presumably the 45-day time limit to file a motion to compel does not commence until service of a verification of the responses. [See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 135-136, 300 CR3d 225, 230-231 (addressing time limits re motion to compel responses to interrogatories)](a) [8:1384] Extensions? The parties may stipulate to an extension (CCP § 2033.290(c)). But whether the court may extend this 45-day period is unclear (the Discovery Act is silent on this point). The court may have inherent power to extend the 45-day deadline before it expires and may be able to grant relief for untimely motions under CCP § 473(b) based on “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” (see ¶ 8:1149 ff.).(b) [8:1384.1] Time limit applicable where only unverified objections received? CCP § 2033.290(c) states that the time limit for bringing a motion to compel further responses runs from the service of a verified response or supplemental verified response. Although not specified in the Discovery Act, the 45-day limit probably also applies where the response is unverified and includes only objections.Comment: Because this issue is not free from doubt, to be safe, you should serve your motion within 45 days of service of unverified objections. See ¶ 8:1150.7 ff.(2) [8:1385] Moving papers: The same Notice of Motion procedure is followed as in connection with a motion to compel further answers to interrogatories (¶ 8:1136 ff.; and see rules and procedures governing motions generally in Ch. 9 Part I).

Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG), may be modified and used to prepare motions to compel further responses to requests for admission.Alternatively, the court may allow the moving party to file a concise outline of matters in dispute in lieu of the separate statement.

Brown, Jr. (Ret.), Current edition authors, Presiding Justice Lee Smalley Edmon and Judge Curtis E.A. Karnow (Ret.)Chapter 8. DiscoveryChapter 8H. Inspection Demands3. [8:1431] WHEN Demand for Inspection May be Made:	a. [8:1432] “Hold” on plaintiff’s demands at outsetb. [8:1433] “Cut-off” before trialc. [8:1434.5] Supplemental demands(1) [8:1434.6] Timing and number of demands(2) [8:1434.7] CommentA CCP § 2031.010 et seq. demand may be made at any time during the lawsuit, subject to the same limitations discussed earlier: a. [8:1432] “Hold” on plaintiff’s demands at outset: As with interrogatories (¶ 8:906), plaintiff may not serve a CCP § 2031.010 demand during the first 10 days after defendant is served or first appears in the action. (The court may shorten this period “for good cause shown.”) [CCP § 2031.020(b); see ¶ 8:908]Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, the “hold” on plaintiff’s demands is only 5 days after service. [CCP § 2031.020(c)] b. [8:1433] “Cut-off” before trial: As with other discovery procedures, there is a “cut-off” on CCP § 2031.010 demands before trial:• A 30-day before the initial trial date deadline on “completing” discovery (meaning responses must be due by that time); and• A 15-day before the initial trial date deadline on the right to have motions to compel discovery heard. [CCP § 2024.020(a); see ¶ 8:445]• Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, the discovery “cut-off” is 5 days before the initial trial date. [CCP § 2024.040(b)(1); see ¶ 8:445] ➪ [8:1434] PRACTICE POINTER: It is often a good idea to serve requests for documents before other discovery procedures. Inspecting the opposing party’s documents or physical evidence in advance will enable you to ask more pertinent questions at deposition or in interrogatories. (And, you don’t have to worry about “wasting” your demands, because there is no limit on the number you can serve; see ¶ 8:1435.1.)Using CCP § 2031.010 requests before a deposition is usually a better idea than noticing document production at the deposition, especially given the seven-hour deposition time limit (see ¶ 8:702). It is often difficult to examine documents “under the gun” at a deposition and to propound intelligent questions based on their contents. Recesses are often required and this runs up the deposition costs. (Also, if you have the documents beforehand, you won’t have to mention them in your deposition notice, and you may be able to “spring” them on an unprepared deponent.) [8:1434.1 - 8:1434.4] Reserved. c. [8:1434.5] Supplemental demands: Supplemental demands may be served to obtain documents or things acquired or discovered by the adverse party after earlier demands were served. [See CCP § 2031.050(a)](1) [8:1434.6] Timing and number of demands: Such supplemental demands may be made:— twice prior to initial setting of a trial date, and— subject to the discovery “cut-off” date (CCP § 2024.010 et seq.), once after the initial setting of a trial date. [CCP § 2031.050(b)]For good cause shown, the court may allow a party to propound additional supplemental demands for inspection. This allows for updating of previously requested information. [CCP § 2031.050(c)](2) [8:1434.7] Comment: The impact of § 2031.050 is unclear. It does not increase the number of permissible demands because there is no numerical limit on inspection demands (see ¶ 8:1435.1). Nor does it extend the time for such demands because supplemental demands are subject to the same discovery “cut-off” as original demands. However, it prevents objections to apparently duplicative responses that might otherwise be asserted. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt.

[8:1451] Service of demandThe party seeking discovery serves a demand for inspection on the party believed to be in possession, custody or control of the documents or property to be inspected. [See CCP § 2031.040] a. [8:1435.1] No limit on number: Unlike interrogatories and RFAs, there is no limit on the number of CCP § 2031.010 et seq. demands that can be served. (Excessive demands are controllable by protective order; see ¶ 8:1452.)(1) [8:1435.2] Limit on number of supplemental demands: Although the number of inspection demands is not otherwise limited, CCP § 2031.050(a) apparently limits the number of supplemental demands (to pick up documents or things acquired after earlier discovery) by requiring a court order based on “good cause” for additional supplemental demands. [CCP § 2031.050(c); see discussion at ¶ 8:1434.5 ff.] b. [8:1436] “Good cause” as limitation: There is no requirement of “good cause” to serve CCP § 2031.010 inspection demands. But the party seeking discovery must be prepared to show “good cause” if the demand is refused because such showing is required to obtain a court order for inspection (¶ 8:1495 ff.). c. [8:1437] Form of demand: CCP § 2031.010 demands must be in writing, and each set of demands must be numbered consecutively. [CCP § 2031.030(a)](1) [8:1437.1] Opening paragraph: The first paragraph under the title of the case must show:• Identity of the propounding party;• Set number; and• Identity of the party who is to respond to the demand. [CCP § 2031.030(b)](a) [8:1437.2] Example: “DEFENDANT JOHN SMITH’S FIRST SET OF DEMANDS FOR DOCUMENT PRODUCTION ON PLAINTIFF ROBERTA BROWN”(2) [8:1437.3] Numbering: Each demand in a set must be identified by number or letter. [CCP § 2031.030(c)](There is no requirement that demands be numbered consecutively from set to set, although it is a good idea to do so.) d. [8:1438] Content: Each demand must be separately set forth and state the following:• Description: Designate the documents or other evidence to be inspected by specifically describing each item or by “reasonably particularizing” each category of item (CCP § 2031.030(c)(1) (emphasis added));• Form in which ESI to be produced: The demanding party may “specify the form or forms in which each type of electronically stored information is to be produced” (CCP § 2031.030(a)(2));• Time for inspection: Specify a reasonable time for the inspection that is at least 30 days after service of the demand (extended for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically per CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, ¶ 9:87 ff.; see CCP § 2016.050) (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2));• Place for inspection: Specify a reasonable place for making the inspection, copying, etc. (CCP § 2031.030(c)(3)); and• Tests, etc.: If the demanding party intends to conduct any tests, sampling or similar activity on the evidence, the demand must so state and also state the manner in which such activity will be performed (CCP § 2031.030(c)(4)).FORM: Demand for Inspection, see Form 8:26 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [8:1439] Description “by category” with “reasonable particularity”: The demanding party is often seeking documents the party has never seen, and which may or may not exist, out of files with which the party has no familiarity. Therefore, the demand is sufficient if the documents or things to be produced are of a category described with “reasonable particularity” in the demand. [CCP § 2031.030(c)(1)]This is the same standard now permitted in deposition notices and deposition subpoenas; see ¶ 8:544 and 8:561 ff.[8:1440 - 8:1441] Reserved.(a) [8:1442] “Reasonably particularized” categories: The categories must be “reasonably” particularized from the standpoint of the party on whom the demand is made. [See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.) (1997) 53 CA4th 216, 222, 61 CR2d 567, 571; see ¶ 8:544.1 ff.]It is not reasonable to describe documents by categories which bear no relationship to the manner in which the documents are kept, and which require the responding party to determine (at risk of sanctions) which of its extensive records fit a demand that asks for everything in its possession relating to a specific topic. [See Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.), supra, 53 CA4th at 222, 61 CR2d at 571; see ¶ 8:544.2]From this perspective, the requesting party should identify the subject matter or transaction in question as narrowly as reasonably possible.1) [8:1443] Thus, requests for “all financial records” or “all correspondence” or “all documents relating to liability” may be objectionable for inadequate description. They embrace too many subcategories to have much meaning.2) [8:1444] But requests for “all correspondence relating to (a particular subject matter)” or “all correspondence between (specific parties or specific dates)” would require response.3) [8:1445] Likewise, a request to identify and produce “any plans or blueprints relating to (designated product)” would also apparently be sufficient to require response.[8:1445.1 - 8:1445.4] Reserved.(2) [8:1445.5] Form in which ESI to be produced: As stated above (¶ 8:1438), the demanding party may “specify the form or forms” in which each type of electronically-stored information (ESI) is to be produced. [CCP § 2031.030(a)(2) (emphasis added)]Common examples of forms in which ESI may be demanded are paper printouts (“hard copy”), PDF and TIFF.Alternatively, a demanding party may specify that documents be produced in various “native” forms—i.e., the formats in which the data was originally created (and is likely maintained), such as Microsoft Word format; or emails in Microsoft Outlook format; or financial spreadsheets in Microsoft Excel format; or graphs or images in JPEG, BMP or PNG formats (which ordinarily are easier to review). Native format usually includes “metadata” (embedded information that shows how, when and by whom the document was created, accessed or modified), whereas conversion of these files into images such as TIFF or PDF may strip out the metadata. (If the responding party keeps the ESI in another form, it can object and state the form in which it will produce the data.)➪ [8:1445.6] PRACTICE POINTERS—FORMULATING DISCOVERY DEMAND: First of all, attempt to negotiate stipulations with opposing counsel as to the form or forms for ESI production (see ¶ 8:1468.5 ff.).If you are unable to obtain effective stipulations from opposing counsel, consider the following guidelines in formulating a discovery plan and implementing discovery demands for ESI:• [8:1445.7] Utilize an expert: If there will be substantial discovery involving ESI, consider retaining a forensic expert at the outset. The expert will be able to help you formulate appropriate discovery requests and estimate costs that may be involved in translating the requested data into a usable form.• [8:1445.8] Utilize preliminary discovery: Before formulating a demand for discovery of ESI, use interrogatories or depositions to obtain information such as:— operating systems used by the responding party;— applications used;— computers and portable devices used and who uses them;— how information is shared and by whom;— name and address of system administrator (if deposition required);— names of databases in which the type of information sought is regularly stored on the computer;— passwords to obtain access to databases;— identity of those who have passwords;— identity of those most likely to have authored or received pertinent emails, or drafted pertinent documents;— whether any computer files have been deleted;— identity of those in the chain of command regarding storage and destruction of records;— retention and destruction policies and practices;— devices used to store records;— location of stored records;— identity of third parties possessing the records;— backup procedures; and— location of any network backup media.• [8:1445.9] Get it right the first time: Consult your expert about the best form for obtaining information from the particular source involved—i.e., computer database, cell phone records, voicemail, etc. If you decide after reviewing some of the ESI produced that a different format would suit you better, the court may be unwilling to order the opposing party to accommodate you. [See CCP § 2031.280(d)(2)—party “need not produce the same electronically stored information in more than one form” (emphasis added)]—. [8:1445.10] Printouts vs. electronic format: Where extensive files are involved, if you ask for a written printout, you may get reams of paper that obscure the information being sought.—. [8:1445.11] Searchability? Consider whether you want electronic files produced as they are kept or in a different format. Some formats provide better searchability. (Again, consult an expert where necessary.)—. [8:1445.12] Readability? Consider whether you want electronic files produced as they are regularly maintained (often native format) with metadata intact (see ¶ 8:1445.5). Files produced with metadata intact may be more difficult to read. You may need proprietary software to read or search native format.[8:1445.13 - 8:1445.14] Reserved.• [8:1445.15] Be careful what you ask for: Asking for more ESI than you really need may trigger even broader ESI demands from your opponent; and your objection to the “undue expense or burden” of your opponent’s demands may be undercut by your own far-reaching demands. Also, you may regret the high costs of reviewing a large data dump.• [8:1445.16] Consider proceeding in stages: When dealing with large volumes of ESI, it is sometimes more cost-effective to proceed in stages by requesting files from which a sampling can be obtained to see whether the files contain relevant information not already available through less burdensome means. Parties also usually agree to rolling productions, spreading the burdens of production and review out over time.(3) [8:1446] “Reasonable” time and place for inspection: The demanding party gets to choose the time, as well as the place, for the inspection. But the date chosen must be at least 30 days after the demand is served (5 days in unlawful detainer actions); and the time and place must be “reasonable.” [CCP § 2031.030(c)(2), (3)]They are subject to control by the court by protective order or on motion to compel. [CCP § 2031.060][8:1447] Comment: The time, place and conditions should be worked out by stipulation between counsel wherever possible. It is usually an unnecessary imposition on the court’s time to resolve disputes as to what is a “reasonable” time or place for inspection of evidence.(a) [8:1448] Burden of production as determinative factor: Absent agreement, courts usually look to whatever burden is involved in producing the evidence. I.e., the more voluminous the records, the more likely inspection will be ordered where the records are usually kept.(b) [8:1449] Conditions may be imposed: Where necessary, the court may make whatever orders are required to assure the evidence is not harmed or changed during the course of inspection (particularly important where tangible evidence is involved). [See CCP § 2031.060(b)(4)](c) [8:1450] Date for inspection vs. date response due: The date designated in the demand for inspection must be at least 30 days after the demand is served (5 days in unlawful detainer actions). [CCP § 2031.030(c)(2)] (The date is extended for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax, or electronic transmission, per CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013 (¶ 9:87.1 ff.); see CCP § 2016.050.)The party on whom the demand is served must also respond to the demand, stating whether it will comply with the demand for inspection on the date demanded. That response is due within 30 days (5 days in unlawful detainer actions) after the demand is served (even if the date for production is later). [CCP § 2031.260; see ¶ 8:1459]➪ [8:1450.1] PRACTICE POINTER: When drafting CCP § 2031.010 demands, consider designating an inspection date at least 60 days later (unless some urgency or discovery order requires earlier inspection). This provides an opportunity to review the responding party’s response (30 days later) and to attempt to resolve any objections before the inspection date. e. [8:1451] Service of demand: Copies of the CCP § 2031.010 demand must be served on the party to whom it is directed and on all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2031.040]Personal service under CCP § 1011 is authorized (CCP § 2016.050). If personal service is made to a party’s residence, it must be made between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. If personal service is made to an attorney’s office and no one is in the office, the papers can be left in a conspicuous place between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. [CCP § 1011(a), (b)(1)] © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[8:1481] Custody of demand and responseUnless excused by protective order (¶ 8:1452 ff.), the party to whom a CCP § 2031.010 demand is directed is under a duty to respond thereto. [CCP § 2031.210(a)] Such response must be:• Timely (¶ 8:1459);• In the proper format (¶ 8:1467); and• Under oath (¶ 8:1477). a. [8:1459] Time limit for response: The response is due 30 days after service of the demand (extended where served by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically; see CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, ¶ 9:87 ff.). [CCP §§ 2031.260, 2016.050]Exception: In unlawful detainer actions, the response is due within 5 days after service of the demand. [CCP § 2031.260]If the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time limit is extended to the next court day closer to the trial date. [CCP § 2016.060](1) [8:1460] Compare—date for production: The time and place for producing the documents must be stated in the demand, and that date must be at least 30 days after service of the demand (CCP § 2031.030(c)(2); see ¶ 8:1450). Regardless of the date for production, the party on whom the demand is made must respond within 30 days after service, stating whether inspection is agreed to, etc. [See CCP § 2031.260](2) [8:1461] Extension by court order: The court has power to extend (or shorten) the time for response on “motion” by the party affected (apparently meaning a noticed motion, rather than ex parte application; see ¶ 8:1026). [CCP § 2031.260]➪ [8:1461.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Although a noticed motion is required, as a practical matter, you may seek a stipulation to defer the response until after the motion is decided or you will probably need to file an ex parte application to hear the motion on shortened notice. Otherwise, you may have to respond to the inspection demand before your motion is heard.(3) [8:1462] Extension by agreement: Likewise, the parties may agree to an extension. The agreement may be informal, but must be confirmed in writing stating the date when the response is due. Unless the agreement provides otherwise, it extends the right to object to the demand. [CCP § 2031.270](4) [8:1463] Delay WAIVES all objections: Failing to respond to a CCP § 2031.010 demand within the time permitted waives all objections to the demand—including claims of privilege and work product. [CCP § 2031.300(a)][8:1464] Reserved.(a) [8:1465] Relief from waiver available: However, the court may grant relief from such waiver. To obtain such relief, the party to whom the demand is directed must have:• Belatedly served a response that is in “substantial compliance” with CCP §§ 2031.210-2031.240, 2031.280; and• Filed a noticed motion supported by declarations showing that the delay resulted from “mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect.” [CCP § 2031.300(a)]1) [8:1465.1] Standard applicable: The same standards apply as for relief from default under CCP § 473(b).

(Green) (1988) 205 CA3d 1459, 1467, 253 CR 296, 300]a) [8:1465.2] Application: Counsel’s simply being busy, or mistake of law on a simple matter (the provisions of a code section), is not “excusable neglect” under CCP § 473(b), and hence not ground for relief under CCP § 2031.300. [City of Fresno v. Sup.Ct. (Green), supra, 205 CA3d at 1467, 253 CR at 300—claimed mistake as to when responses were due; Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct.

[Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Spyglass Homeowners Ass’n), supra, 59 CA4th at 275, 69 CR2d at 119]CCP § 473(b) relief is available in discovery proceedings only where there is no analogous provision for relief under the Discovery Act. [See Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1107, 1 CR2d 222, 228, discussed at ¶ 8:10.10]Comment: The significance of course is that it is often easier to obtain relief under CCP § 473(b); see discussion at ¶ 8:10.14 ff.(b) [8:1466] Compare—no waiver of Pen.C. § 832.7 protection: Peace officer personnel files and records of citizen complaints regarding police officers are subject to disclosure only pursuant to Ev.C. §§ 1043, 1046 (so-called “Pitchess” motions, requiring showing of “good cause,” court hearing, in camera inspection, etc.). [Pen.C. § 832.7, discussed at ¶ 8:126 ff.]This limitation on discovery overrides the general policy evidenced in the waiver provisions of CCP § 2031.300(a). Thus, untimely response to an inspection demand does not by itself entitle the demanding party to records protected under Pen.C. § 832.7. I.e., the objection may be raised even though the response is untimely. [City of Fresno v. Sup.Ct. (Green) (1988) 205 CA3d 1459, 1476-1477, 253 CR 296, 306] b. [8:1467] Format of response: The format rules are similar to those governing responses to interrogatories (see ¶ 8:1039 ff.).(1) [8:1467.1] Opening paragraph: The first paragraph below the title of the case must state:• The identity of the responding party;• The identity of the propounding party; and• The set number to which the response pertains. [CCP § 2031.210(b)](a) [8:1467.2] Example: “DEFENDANT MARY BROWN’S RESPONSE TO PLAINTIFF PAUL BLACK’S DEMANDS FOR DOCUMENT PRODUCTION, SET NO. 3”(2) [8:1467.3] Numbering: Each item in the response must bear the same number (or letter) and be in the same sequence as the item or category in the demand to which it pertains. [CCP § 2031.210(c)](3) [8:1467.4] Demand need not be repeated: The text of the demand itself, however, need not be repeated. [CCP § 2031.210(c)]➪ [8:1468] PRACTICE POINTER: Although not required, many lawyers prefer to do so. It saves working with different documents and pages.Alternatively, ask the propounding party to send you an electronic version of the inspection demand and offer to provide your responses on that version; or simply agree to always exchange electronic versions.[8:1468.1 - 8:1468.4] Reserved.(4) [8:1468.5] Specifying form for ESI: If the party responding to a demand for production of ESI objects to the form specified in the discovery demand, or if no form is specified in the demand, the responding party “shall state in its response the form in which it intends to produce each type of information.” [CCP § 2031.280(c) (emphasis added); see ¶ 8:1445.5]If the demanding party objects to the form stated by the responding party, the demanding party will have to file a motion to compel to resolve the issue (subject to the “meet and confer” requirement and 45-day time limit; see ¶ 8:1490 ff.).(a) [8:1468.6] Same information need not be provided in multiple forms: The responding party need not provide the same information in more than one form, unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise. [CCP § 2031.280(d)(2)](b) [8:1468.7] If no form specified in demand, information may be produced as regularly maintained: Where the demand does not specify a form for producing ESI, it “shall” be produced in the form “in which it is ordinarily maintained” or in a form “that is reasonably usable,” unless the parties agree or the court orders otherwise. [CCP § 2031.280(d)(1) (emphasis added)](c) [8:1468.8] “Translation” costs chargeable to demanding party: “If necessary,” the responding party shall “through detection devices” translate any electronic data included in the demand into a reasonably usable form “at the reasonable expense of the demanding party.” [CCP § 2031.280(e) (emphasis added)]FORM: Response to Inspection Demand, see Form 8:26.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). c. [8:1469] Content: The party to whom the CCP § 2031.010 demand is directed must respond separately to each item in the demand by one of the following:• Agreement to comply: A statement that the party will comply by the date set for inspection with the particular demand for inspection, testing, etc.; or• Representation of inability to comply: A statement that the party lacks the ability to comply with the particular demand; or• Objections: An objection to all or part of the demand. [CCP § 2031.210(a)]If only part of an item or category demanded is objectionable, the response must contain an agreement to comply with the remainder, or a representation of inability to comply. [CCP § 2031.240(a)] (General objections to the entire request are unauthorized and constitute discovery misuse; see ¶ 8:1071 (dealing with interrogatories).)(1) [8:1470] Agreement to comply: The response must be rather specific as to what is agreed to. It must state:• That the production and inspection demanded will be allowed (in whole or in part); and• That the documents or things in the demanded category that are in the responding party’s possession, custody or control will be produced (except to the extent of any objections; see ¶ 8:1474 ff.). [CCP § 2031.220](a) [8:1471] What constitutes “compliance”: Documents must be sorted and labeled to correspond with the categories in the document demand. [CCP § 2031.280(a); see Pollock v. Sup.Ct. (Schuster) (2023) 93 CA5th 1348, 1359, 311 CR3d 744, 750-751—failure to correlate demands with produced documents was cured with “table that listed by Bates number which documents applied to which requests”] (Prior law permitted production of documents as they were kept in the ordinary course of business.)[8:1471.1 - 8:1471.4] Reserved.1) [8:1471.5] Sanctions possible for noncompliance: Sanctions may be assessed for production of documents that are in complete disorder if the court finds that the producing party is responsible for the disordered state. [Kayne v. Grande Holdings Ltd. (2011) 198 CA4th 1470, 1476, 130 CR3d 751, 755—producing party ordered to pay more than $74,000 of costs incurred by opposing party to organize documents; see ¶ 8:1508.2a](b) [8:1472] Producing electronically-stored information (ESI) in “usable form”: If necessary, the responding party must “through detection devices, translate any data compilations included in the demand into reasonably usable form” at the “reasonable expense of the demanding party.” [CCP § 2031.280(e) (emphasis added); see ¶ 8:1445.5][8:1472.1 - 8:1472.4] Reserved.1) [8:1472.5] “Reasonably usable form”: Although the statute is not explicit, “reasonably usable form” presumably means the ESI must be produced in a form that a party can access and read, which in some cases may be a paper printout or in other cases may be an electronically readable and searchable file using commonly available programs.a) [8:1472.5a] PDF vs. native format? Under persuasive federal precedent (see ¶ 8:19.15 ff.), production of ESI in PDF format “may not be sufficient if the requesting party can show that the format [is] not ‘reasonably usable’ and that the native format, with accompanying metadata, meet the criteria of reasonably usable” while the PDF format does not. [Ellis v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (2013) 218 CA4th 853, 862, 160 CR3d 557, 566, fn. 6 (internal quotes omitted)]b) [8:1472.6] Compare—demanding party may specify form: The demanding party can ensure that the ESI will be “usable” on its computer by specifying the form of production in its discovery demand (CCP § 2031.030(a)(2); see ¶ 8:1445.5).➪ [8:1472.7] PRACTICE POINTER: Where a large number of documents are required to be produced, it is usually a good idea for the parties to stipulate that the documents be produced electronically (e.g., in a document depository or cloud-based storage system) or on CD-ROM or other storage device rather than by hard copies. This is particularly helpful where numerous parties are entitled to production. An additional benefit of an electronic data exchange is that all parties have an identical record of what was produced.[8:1472.8 - 8:1472.9] Reserved.2) [8:1472.10] “Reasonable expense” to be paid by demanding party: The “reasonable expense” of translating the data into “reasonably usable form” must be paid by the demanding party.” [CCP § 2031.280(e)]➪ [8:1472.11] PRACTICE POINTER: What is a “reasonable” expense may give rise to lengthy disputes that will delay discovery. Therefore, be conservative in your demands for ESI. Seek expert advice on framing your requests to minimize any “translation” cost involved.a) [8:1472.12] Protective orders available: The demanding party may seek a protective order (CCP § 2031.060(b)(4)) if asked to pay for translations of ESI it does not deem “necessary” or if it disputes the “reasonableness” of the expenses alleged. [Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Lexar Media, Inc.) (2004) 124 CA4th 762, 772, 21 CR3d 532, 540—“Reasonableness and necessity are purely factual issues … which … are properly submitted to the discretion of the trial court”]➪ [8:1472.13] PRACTICE POINTER RE EXPERT TESTIMONY: The technical difficulty and the expense associated with recovering electronic data and translating it into a usable form usually requires declarations from qualified experts. Because the court may wish to inquire from the experts directly, they should be selected and prepared to answer questions in court.If the “battle of experts” does not clarify the matters sufficiently for the court to decide, the court has the ability to appoint its own expert at the parties’ expense as allocated by the court (see Ev.C. §§ 730, 731).All of this is likely to be very time-consuming for counsel and expensive for the parties. It is counsel’s responsibility to negotiate compromises and avoid this kind of dispute wherever possible.[8:1472.14] Reserved.3) [8:1472.15] Searches of computer backup media: Computer backup media (including tapes, CDs and other storage devices) provide a means of recovering lost data in the event of a system failure. The difficulty with searching backup media is that they hold a large amount of data that is difficult and often expensive to access. Consequently, finding and restoring relevant data from a large number of backup media can be an expensive and time-consuming process. [Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Lexar Media, Inc.), supra, 124 CA4th at 768, 21 CR3d at 537 (decided prior to enactment of statute)]➪ [8:1472.16] PRACTICE POINTER: To reduce costs of producing ESI stored on backup media, parties are encouraged to “meet and confer” about translating a sample of the ESI before full compliance.

(Lexar Media, Inc.), supra, 124 CA4th at 773, 21 CR3d at 541-542](2) [8:1473] Inability to comply: A response stating inability to comply with the CCP § 2031.010 demand shall state the following:• That a diligent search and reasonable inquiry has been made in an effort to locate the item demanded; and• The reason the party is unable to comply: e.g., the document:— never existed; or— has been lost or stolen; or— has been destroyed; or— is not in the possession, custody or control of the responding party, in which case, the response must state the name and address of anyone believed to have the document. [CCP § 2031.230](3) [8:1474] Objections: The responding party may object to any item or category demanded in whole or in part. To be effective, the objection must:• Identify with particularity the specific document or evidence demanded as to which the objection is made; and• Set forth the specific ground for objection, including claims of privilege or work product protection. [CCP § 2031.240(b); see Standon Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Kim) (1990) 225 CA3d 898, 901, 275 CR 833, 834—objections constitute implicit refusals to produce][8:1474.1 - 8:1474.4] Reserved.(a) [8:1474.5] Objection based on privilege; “privilege log” may be required: When asserting claims of privilege or attorney work product protection, the objecting party must provide “sufficient factual information” to enable other parties to evaluate the merits of the claim, “including, if necessary, a privilege log.” [CCP § 2031.240(c)(1) (emphasis added); Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc.

[Hernandez v. Sup.Ct. (Acheson Indus., Inc.) (2003) 112 CA4th 285, 291-292, 4 CR3d 883, 888-889, fn. 6; see CCP § 2031.240(c)(2)—Legislative intent to codify concept of privilege log “as that term is used in California case law”]“The information in the privilege log must be sufficiently specific to allow a determination of whether each withheld document is or is not [in] fact privileged.” [Wellpoint Health Networks, Inc. v.

(Beatty) (2015) 242 CA4th 1116, 1130, 195 CR3d 694, 704 & fn. 5—privilege log deficient due to failure to describe documents or contents (other than noting they were emails with counsel) since not all communications with attorneys are privileged]FORM: Privilege Log, see Form 8:26.2 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).2) [8:1474.5b] No undue burden defense to preparing privilege log: There is no “burden” defense to the “statutory requirement” to produce a privilege log. [Riddell, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Ace American Ins. Co.) (2017) 14 CA5th 755, 772, 222 CR3d 384, 397]3) [8:1474.6] May be required at time of objection: The Code seems to indicate that if a privilege log is “necessary” to enable other parties to evaluate the merits of a privilege or work product claim, it must be provided by the objecting party with the response to the § 2031.010 inspection demand (i.e., at the time the objection is made). [See CCP § 2031.240(c)(1)—if objection is based on privilege or work product claim, “the response shall provide … including, if necessary, a privilege log”]a) [8:1474.6a] Comment: This is not entirely clear, however: CCP § 2031.240(c)(2) provides that the Legislature did not, by codifying the concept of a privilege log, intend to make any “substantive change in case law.” Preexisting case law indicates a privilege log need not necessarily be served at the time a privilege or work product objection is made (see ¶ 8:1474.8 ff.). And at least one case confirms that a tardy privilege log (served nearly two months after the objections) is sufficient to preserve the privilege. [Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Sup.Ct. (Beatty), supra, 242 CA4th at 1126, 195 CR3d at 700-701 (¶ 8:1498.6)]➪ [8:1474.7] PRACTICE POINTER: In any event, serving a privilege log along with the objection often will make sense. It may make apparent to opposing parties that they would be unsuccessful in an attempt to compel disclosure. Similarly, including the log as part of an opposition to a motion to compel may permit the court to deny the motion without further proceedings.4) [8:1474.8] May be required by court in response to motion to compel: In ruling on a motion to compel document production, the court may require the party who objected on the ground of privilege to prepare and serve a privilege log. The purpose is to make a record of the documents withheld and the privilege claim asserted as to each. [Wellpoint Health Networks, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (McCombs), supra, 59 CA4th at 130, 68 CR2d at 857; Best Products, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Granatelli Motorsports, Inc.) (2004) 119 CA4th 1181, 1188-1189, 15 CR3d 154, 159]5) [8:1474.9] May be required in connection with motion for protective order: In ruling on a motion for protective order to prevent discovery directed at privileged documents, the court may order the moving party to prepare a privilege log to assist it in ruling on the privilege claims. [Bank of America, N.A. v. Sup.Ct. (Pacific City Bank) (2013) 212 CA4th 1076, 1099, 151 CR3d 526, 543—court-ordered privilege log sufficient to enable court to rule on all privilege objections]6) [8:1474.10] Appellate court review: Normally, appellate courts will not review pretrial discovery orders (¶ 8:14). But an exception is frequently made where the order requires disclosure of information claimed to be privileged. Here, writ review (by mandamus or prohibition) is often granted because redress after disclosure of privileged information would, of course, be impossible. [Sav-On Drugs, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Botney) (1975) 15 C3d 1, 5, 123 CR 283, 285-286; Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Randall) (2009) 47 C4th 725, 740-741, 101 CR3d 758, 770-771; Palmer v. Sup.Ct. (Mireskandari) (2014) 231 CA4th 1214, 1224, 180 CR3d 620, 627]➪ [8:1474.11] PRACTICE POINTER: If you plan to seek writ review and need additional time, ask for a temporary stay of the discovery order to allow you to prepare your petition without risking sanctions for violation. Most judges will grant such requests.(b) [8:1475] Other grounds: The objections most likely to be sustained to a CCP § 2031.010 demand are:• Beyond the scope of permissible discovery (not relevant to the subject matter or likely to lead to discovery of admissible evidence);• Privilege, work product, trade secrets, police officer records, or right of privacy;• Oppressive and burdensome (i.e., compliance would be unreasonably difficult and expensive).(c) [8:1475a] Standing to raise privacy objections: Third parties, including doctors, may assert the privacy rights of patients.

Production was upheld because the orders were directly relevant to the action, patient-identifying information was redacted (so privacy was not violated, see ¶ 8:306.1) and, since only 160 orders were involved, the burden was not unreasonable. [Snibbe v. Sup.Ct. (Gilbert) (2014) 224 CA4th 184, 196-197, 168 CR3d 548, 558-559]However, redacting personally identifying information may not suffice to protect privacy interests.

Also, D made no efforts to design a search, consult with an expert qualified to conduct a search or take any steps to locate responsive documents or offer suggestions on how to reasonably narrow the requests. Thus, the trial court was not required to credit D’s burden claim. [Lopez v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of New York, Inc.

[CCP § 2031.210(d)]1) [8:1475.11] Must identify types or categories: To make an effective objection on this ground, the response must identify the types or categories of ESI that the responding party claims are not reasonably accessible. [CCP § 2031.210(d)]2) [8:1475.12] No waiver of other objections: By objecting and identifying the sources not searched, the party preserves all other objections it may have to producing that electronically-stored information. [CCP § 2031.210(d)]3) [8:1475.13] Either “undue” burden or expense: The objection may be based on the ground that the source is not reasonably accessible because of either undue burden or undue expense. [CCP § 2031.210(d)]a) [8:1475.14] Comment: The statute provides no guidance for determining how much burden or expense is “undue.” As a result, this determination will have to be made by the court on a case-by-case basis in exercise of its power “to manage discovery and to prevent misuse of discovery procedures.” [Toshiba America Electronic Components, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Lexar Media, Inc.) (2004) 124 CA4th 762, 768-772, 21 CR3d 532, 538-541 (predating enactment of statute)]Cross-refer: For a list of factors the court may use in balancing the “benefits vs. burdens” of proposed discovery, see ¶ 8:74.1.➪ [8:1475.15] PRACTICE POINTER—BURDEN ON OBJECTING PARTY: Counsel should be careful in raising a “not reasonably accessible” objection to any demand for ESI from an opposing party. Keep in mind that on a motion to compel, the objecting party has the burden of proof, based on admissible evidence, on this issue. If it turns out that the data is accessible without much effort or expense, sanctions may be imposed and they could be substantial (particularly where the moving party produced expert testimony).[8:1475.16 - 8:1475.19] Reserved.(f) [8:1475.20] Objection that ESI production unnecessary or unreasonably burdensome: The court “shall” (must) limit the “frequency or extent of discovery” if the demanding party moves to compel and the court finds the responding party has a valid objection to production on one of the following grounds (which are also grounds for a protective order):— the ESI demanded is available from other more convenient sources;— the ESI is cumulative or duplicative;— the demanding party was dilatory; or— the burdens of producing the ESI outweigh any benefits. [CCP § 2031.060(f); discussed at ¶ 8:1456.40 ff. re protective orders]1) [8:1475.21] Comment: Although CCP § 2031.210(d) does not state these grounds may be raised as objections to an ESI demand, that seems implicit because the court must limit discovery when any of these conditions are found to exist on a motion for protective order or a motion to compel. [See CCP § 2031.310(g)]➪ [8:1476] PRACTICE POINTERS: If you are going to object to inspection, make sure there is “substantial justification” for your position. (Don’t rely solely on the fact that the moving party will have to show “good cause” for an order compelling discovery; ¶ 8:1495.)Don’t make objections on grounds you are not relying on to withhold documents from production.Blanket objections (e.g., “all documents sought are irrelevant and immaterial”) are ineffective and likely to result in waiver of any valid ground for objection, plus sanctions for failure to make discovery.Avoid raising the “burdensome and oppressive” objection unless the facts are truly unusual (e.g., very fragile property which could be damaged by any movement, touching, etc.). If you are going to object in such a case, state the reasons for your objection and offer to permit whatever inspection can be allowed under the circumstances.Instead of objecting to the demand, you will usually be better off seeking limits on the inspection beforehand by stipulation with demanding party’s counsel.(g) [8:1476.1] Waiver by failure to object: A party whose response fails to set forth a particular ground for objection waives its right to raise that objection later. [Stadish v. Sup.Ct. (Southern Calif. Gas Co.) (1999) 71 CA4th 1130, 1141, 84 CR2d 350, 356—by objecting only on ground of attorney-client privilege, D waived trade secret privilege objection (but protective order still available; see ¶ 8:1454.2)]But, as discussed above (¶ 8:1475.10 ff.), this is not true in the ESI context.[8:1476.2 - 8:1476.4] Reserved.(4) [8:1476.5] Standards of professionalism governing response: Some bar associations and courts have adopted guidelines to discourage discovery misuse. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.26, Appendix 3.A(f)(3)—counsel should not strain to interpret document demands restrictively in order to avoid disclosure]Because local rules relating to discovery are preempted by CRC 3.20, a court may not sanction a party for violation of these guidelines. Nonetheless, the prohibited conduct may be sanctionable as discovery misuse (CCP § 2023.010; see ¶ 8:1901). d. [8:1477] Signature and verification: The response must be signed “under oath” by the party to whom it is directed. That party’s attorney must also sign if the response contains an objection. If it consists entirely of objections, only the attorney’s signature is required. [CCP § 2031.250](1) [8:1477.1] Verification by “Doe” sufficient: Where plaintiff files an action under a fictitious name to preserve anonymity (¶ 2:136.5 ff.), plaintiff may verify discovery responses by signing the fictitious name. [Doe v. Sup.Ct. (Luster) (2011) 194 CA4th 750, 756, 123 CR3d 557, 561—trial court erred in requiring plaintiff to provide verifications in her true name](2) [8:1478] “On information and belief” permissible where officer signs on behalf of entity? See discussion in connection with interrogatories at ¶ 8:1106.(3) [8:1479] Attorney verifying on behalf of entity: See discussion in connection with interrogatories at ¶ 8:1107.1 ff.(4) [8:1479.1] Effect of unverified response containing responses and objections: Where the response contains both agreements to comply and objections, the portion containing the objections need not be under oath. Therefore, the response is effective to preserve the objections stated therein even though unverified. [Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher) (1995) 40 CA4th 651, 657, 46 CR2d 925, 928]The other portion of the response (agreements to comply) should be verified, and the lack of verification renders the agreement to comply untimely. But that only creates a right to move for orders and sanctions (under CCP § 2031.310; see ¶ 8:1483); there is no waiver of the stated objections. [Food 4 Less Supermarkets, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Fletcher), supra, 40 CA4th at 657, 46 CR2d at 928] e. [8:1480] Service of response: The original of the response is served on the demanding party; copies are served on all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2031.260] f. [8:1481] Custody of demand and response: Neither the demand nor response is filed with the court. The demanding party retains the original demand and receives the original response from the responding party. These originals must be retained by the demanding party until 6 months after final disposition of the action.

[8:1508.15] Sanctions in post-trial proceedingsA motion to compel is the procedure to enforce compliance with a CCP § 2031.010 demand:• Where no response at all has been made, the motion is to compel a response (CCP § 2031.300, see ¶ 8:1483);• Where responses have been made but they are not satisfactory to the demanding party, the motion is to compel further responses (CCP § 2031.310, see ¶ 8:1490); and• Where an agreement to comply has been made, but compliance is not forthcoming, the motion is to compel compliance (CCP § 2031.320, see ¶ 8:1503). a. [8:1483] Where NO response made—motion to compel response: Where there has been no timely response to a CCP § 2031.010 demand, the first thing the demanding party must do is to seek an order compelling a response. [CCP § 2031.300](1) [8:1483.1] No objections: Failure to timely respond waives all objections, including privilege and work product (see ¶ 8:1463). So, unless the party to whom the demand was directed obtains relief from waiver (¶ 8:1465), the party cannot raise objections to the documents demanded.(2) [8:1484] No time limit: There is no deadline for a motion to compel responses (other than the “cut-offs” on discovery before trial; see ¶ 8:1262).(a) [8:1485] Waiver or estoppel as limit: But the demanding party cannot always delay a motion to compel with impunity. If the delay has resulted in “substantial prejudice” to the party to whom it was directed (e.g., documents no longer available), the court may find that the demanding party has waived the right to compel response and disclosure. [See Crippen v. Sup.Ct. (Kaiser) (1984) 159 CA3d 254, 260, 205 CR 477, 480—decided under former law, but principle presumably still valid](3) [8:1486] No “attempt to resolve informally” required: Likewise, for failure to respond, the moving party need not attempt to resolve the matter outside court before filing the motion. [See CCP § 2031.300](4) [8:1487] No “good cause” requirement: Where the motion seeks only a response to the inspection demand, no showing of “good cause” is required (whereas such showing is required for an order compelling further responses; see ¶ 8:1495).(5) [8:1488] Monetary sanction against losing party: If a motion to compel response is filed and a party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party unless it finds that party made or opposed the motion “with substantial justification” or other reasons make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2031.300(c)]In addition, when reviewing a sanctions request relating to a motion to compel a document production response, if the court finds that a party, person or attorney did not respond in good faith to the request for production, failed to meet and confer in good faith, or produced requested documents within seven days of a hearing on the motion to compel, the court shall impose sanctions of $1000 unless it makes written findings that the one subject to the sanction acted “with substantial justification” or other circumstances make imposition of the sanction “unjust.” If an attorney is sanctioned, the court has discretion to order the attorney to report the sanction to the State Bar. [CCP § 2023.050(a)-(c)](Monetary sanctions on discovery motions are discussed at ¶ 8:1921 ff.)(a) [8:1488.1] “Substantial justification” for refusal to comply: See discussion at ¶ 8:1964 ff.[8:1488.2 - 8:1488.4] Reserved.(b) [8:1488.5] Limitation—no sanctions (“safe harbor”) where ESI lost or destroyed due to good faith operation of computer system: Absent exceptional circumstances, no sanctions may be imposed for failure to produce electronically-stored information (ESI) that has been lost, damaged, altered or overwritten as a result of the “routine, good faith operation of an electronic information system.” [CCP §§ 2031.300(d)(1), 2031.310(j)(1) (emphasis added)]1) [8:1488.6] Prelitigation duty to preserve ESI: A party has a prelitigation duty to preserve material evidence if litigation is “reasonably foreseeable.” [Victor Valley Union High School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Doe) (2023) 91 CA5th 1121, 1138, 1144, 309 CR3d 258, 269, 274]The test is an objective one, and is met when “the future litigation [is] probable or likely to arise from an event, and not merely when litigation [is] a remote possibility.” [Victor Valley Union High School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Doe), supra, 91 CA5th at 1138, 1144, 309 CR3d at 269, 274]If ESI is destroyed when a party is thus on notice, the safe harbor provisions of CCP § 2023.030(f)(1) do not shield that party from sanctions. [Victor Valley Union High School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Doe), supra, 91 CA5th at 1142, 309 CR3d at 272-273](6) [8:1489] Additional sanctions if order disobeyed: If the motion to compel is granted and the party disobeys the court’s order to respond, additional sanctions may then be imposed: i.e., an “issue sanction,” “evidence sanction” or even a “terminating (doomsday) sanction”—plus additional monetary sanctions. [CCP §§ 2031.300(c), 2023.030(b)-(d); see also Kravitz v. Sup.Ct. (Milner) (2001) 91 CA4th 1015, 1020-1021, 111 CR2d 385, 389 (citing text); Los Defensores, Inc. v. Gomez (2014) 223 CA4th 377, 390-392, 166 CR3d 899, 910-912—terminating sanction (entry of default) justified based on party’s willful failure to comply with order compelling production of documents (including evidence of concealment or destruction of records); and ¶ 8:2145 ff.]• [8:1489.1] Following settlement of a class action lawsuit, defendant sought forensic examination of plaintiff’s Attorney’s hard drive in response to Attorney’s statement that she would seek over $26 million in fees. The trial court ultimately ordered Attorney to allow the examination, which she refused. The court did not abuse its discretion in imposing $165,000 in sanctions, representing defendant’s expenses in seeking compliance, based on Attorney’s refusal to comply with the court order and to meet and confer in good faith. Attorney’s contention that the trial court’s order was “legally erroneous” was not a substantial justification for refusing to comply with the discovery order. Rather, “[t]he record … strongly indicates that the purpose of [Attorney’s] behavior was … to generally obstruct the self-executing process of discovery.” [Ellis v. Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. (2013) 218 CA4th 853, 879, 160 CR3d 557, 579-580 (internal quotes omitted); see CCP § 2023.010(g), (i)] b. [8:1490] Where response UNSATISFACTORY—motion to compel further response: Where a response has been made, but the demanding party is not satisfied with it, the remedy is a motion to compel further responses. [CCP § 2031.310]This motion can be utilized to attack a response containing:• Objections; or• An agreement to comply that is incomplete; or• A statement of inability to comply that is incomplete or evasive. [CCP § 2031.310(a)][8:1490.1 - 8:1490.4] Reserved.➪ [8:1490.5] PRACTICE POINTER—WHERE RESPONSE STATES ESI DOES NOT EXIST: If the responding party claims the demanded ESI does not exist or has been destroyed, the demanding party may, on a showing of “good cause” (¶ 8:1495), seek an order for a search of the responding party’s computer and backup systems.• [8:1490.6] Engage expert: Courts are likely to require the demanding party to employ a forensic expert for this purpose, at the demanding party’s own expense, because data on the responding party’s computer may be destroyed by improper handling. The court may also order the expert not to access or copy confidential data (e.g., customer lists, trade secrets, privileged communications, etc.). In some cases, the court may require an expert to serve as a neutral on any disputes relating to the ESI.• [8:1490.7] Anticipate objections: The responding party is likely to object on grounds of “undue burden and expense” and/or “privileged matter.” To deflect such objections, consider offering the following:— to pay all costs associated with the information recovery;— to mirror (make an exact replica of) the drive and use that, instead of the production drive in use by the party, for your examination;— to schedule the search before or after normal business hours in order to minimize “down time” on the responding party’s computers; and— that any information recovered be reviewed initially by the responding party’s attorney, with an opportunity to withhold and object to disclosure of material beyond the permissible scope of discovery.(1) [8:1491] 45-day time limit: This motion must be served within 45 days after service of a verified response (extended if served by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically; see CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, ¶ 9:87 ff.). Otherwise, the demanding party waives the right to compel any further response to the CCP § 2031.010 demand. [CCP §§ 2031.310(c), 2016.050; see Sperber v. Robinson (1994) 26 CA4th 736, 745, 31 CR2d 659, 664]The 45-day time limit is mandatory and “jurisdictional” (court has no authority to grant a late motion). [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712—late-filed motion to compel must be denied where objection raised at hearing even if omitted in opposition papers]Comment: If the responding party serves unverified responses containing objections and substantive responses, presumably the 45-day time limit does not commence until the verifications are served. [See Golf & Tennis Pro Shop, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Frye) (2022) 84 CA5th 127, 135-136, 300 CR3d 225, 230-231 (addressing 45-day time limit for filing motion to compel responses to interrogatories)](a) [8:1491.1] Computation: The 45-day deadline runs from the date the verified response is served, not from the date originally set for production or inspection. [CCP § 2031.310(c); Standon Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Kim) (1990) 225 CA3d 898, 903, 275 CR 833, 835](b) [8:1491.1a] Extension for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically: The 45-day deadline is extended for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically, in accordance with CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013. [CCP § 2016.050; see ¶ 9:87 ff.](c) [8:1492] Extension by stipulation: The deadline may be extended by written stipulation of the parties (CCP § 2031.310(c)).1) [8:1492.1] Extension by court order? There is no statutory provision for extension by court order. Presumably, the court has inherent power to extend the 45-day deadline before it expires. But relief thereafter is doubtful. The 45-day time limit on motions to compel has been described as “jurisdictional.” [Sexton v. Sup.Ct. (Mullikin Med. Ctr.) (1997) 58 CA4th 1403, 1409-1410, 68 CR2d 708, 712]However, the court in Sexton did not discuss or consider whether relief for untimely motions was available under CCP § 473(b) based on “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect” (see ¶ 8:1150).(d) [8:1492.1a] Waiver bars later demand: Missing the 45-day deadline waives the right to compel a further response to the demand (CCP § 2031.310(c)) or to compel inspection of any documents that might have been identified in such a further response (see CCP § 2031.320(a)). [New Albertsons, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Shanahan) (2008) 168 CA4th 1403, 1427-1428, 86 CR3d 457, 476](e) [8:1492.2] Compare—waiver no bar to document inspection at deposition: Despite missing the deadline to compel production under § 2031.310(c), the demanding party may obtain the documents by noticing the deposition of the party with the documents, and including a demand for production in the deposition notice. I.e., waiver of the right to compel production under § 2031.310(c) does not affect a party’s right to compel inspection at a deposition. [Carter v. Sup.Ct. (CSAA Inter-Insurance Bureau) (1990) 218 CA3d 994, 997, 267 CR 290, 291; see ¶ 8:521]➪ [8:1492.3] PRACTICE POINTER: Don’t forget the clock is ticking while you negotiate with opposing counsel under the statutorily-required “meet and confer” procedure. You have slightly more than 6 weeks to serve a motion to compel (unless opposing counsel stipulates to an extension).If you do miss the deadline, you can insist on production at a deposition (see ¶ 8:1492.2). But that is more expensive; and it may not be possible if you have already taken the opposing party’s deposition.(f) [8:1492.4] Time limit applicable where only unverified objections received? CCP § 2031.310(c) states that the time limit for bringing a motion to compel further responses runs from the service of a verified response or supplemental verified response. Although not specified in the Discovery Act, the 45-day limit probably also applies where the response is unverified and includes only objections.Comment: Because this issue is not free from doubt, to be safe, you should serve your motion within 45 days of service of unverified objections. See ¶ 8:1150.7 ff.(2) [8:1493] Moving papers: The motion to compel further responses should comply with the same CRC 3.1345 format requirements discussed in connection with interrogatories (see ¶ 8:1151 ff.). As with motions to compel responses to interrogatories, the court has discretion to permit the moving party to submit, in lieu of a separate statement, a concise outline of matters in dispute. [CCP § 2031.310(b)(3); see ¶ 8:532.12, 8:1157.3 ff.]FORMS• Motion to Compel [Further] Responses to Demands for Inspection and for Sanctions and Proposed Order, see Form 8:28 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG)• Statement of Disputed Responses to Demands for Inspection, see Form 8:28.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).• Concise Outline of Interrogatories and Responses in Dispute, see Form 8:20.1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). (This form can be modified for use in moving to compel further responses to Inspection Demands.)(3) [8:1494] “Attempt to resolve informally” required: The motion to compel further responses must be accompanied by a declaration showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues outside of court. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2031.310(b)(2)]Cross-refer: The requirement is discussed in greater detail in connection with interrogatories at ¶ 8:1158 ff.(a) [8:1494.1] Compare—informal discovery conference to resolve dispute: Many judges on a case-by-case basis allow for or require informal conferences with the court to resolve discovery disputes. A party may request, or the court on its own motion may schedule, an informal discovery conference. (See discussion at ¶ 8:787.1.)(4) [8:1495] “Good cause” for production required: The motion for order compelling further responses “shall set forth specific facts showing good cause justifying the discovery sought by the demand.” [CCP § 2031.310(b)(1) (emphasis added); Kirkland v. Sup.Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 CA4th 92, 98, 115 CR2d 279, 284 (citing text)](a) [8:1495.1] Comment: One rationale of the “good cause” requirement is that production of documents or other physical evidence may involve a greater intrusion on one’s privacy than merely answering questions. Hence, higher standards are required for discovery.(b) [8:1495.2] Protects party’s trial preparations: Another purpose served by the “good cause” requirement is to protect materials obtained or created by a party or its insurer in anticipation of litigation, such as witness statements. Such statements may only be ordered produced on a showing of “good cause.” [See Greyhound Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (Clay) (1961) 56 C2d 355, 401, 15 CR 90, 106 (superseded by statute on other grounds); ¶ 8:238 ff. (witness statements)]1) [8:1495.3] Compare—attorney work product: A bare showing of “good cause” is insufficient to compel production of materials constituting attorney work product. Although some work product is never discoverable (e.g., attorney opinions, conclusions, etc.), other work product may be ordered disclosed, but only if the party seeking discovery can demonstrate injustice or unfair prejudice, a much heavier burden. [CCP § 2018.030(b); see ¶ 8:222 ff.][8:1495.4] Reserved.(c) [8:1495.5] Effect: Although no showing of “good cause” is required for the inspection demand, the demanding party must be prepared to make such showing if the demand is refused. This effectively bars the use of CCP § 2031.010 et seq. for purely “fishing expeditions.”(d) [8:1495.6] Showing required: To establish “good cause,” the burden is on the moving party to show both:• Relevance to the subject matter (e.g., how the information in the documents would tend to prove or disprove some issue in the case); and• Specific facts justifying discovery (e.g., why such information is necessary for trial preparation or to prevent surprise at trial). [Glenfed Develop. Corp. v. Sup.Ct. (National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Penn.) (1997) 53 CA4th 1113, 1117, 62 CR2d 195, 197 (citing text); see also Kirkland v. Sup.Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 CA4th 92, 98, 115 CR2d 279, 284 (citing text)]The fact that there is no alternative source for the information sought is an important factor in establishing “good cause” for inspection. But it is not essential in every case. [Associated Brewers Distributing Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co.) (1967) 65 C2d 583, 588, 55 CR 772, 775 (decided under former law)] (e) [8:1495.7] Evidence required: Declarations are generally used to show the requisite “good cause” for an order to compel inspection. The declarations must contain “specific facts” rather than mere conclusions. [Fireman’s Fund Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Paine Webber Real Estate Secur.) (1991) 233 CA3d 1138, 1141, 286 CR 50, 51—P’s desire to review documents for “context” is “a patently insufficient ground” for production of sensitive commercial information]1) [8:1495.8] Allegations on information and belief: The declarations may be on information and belief, if necessary. However, in such cases, the “specific facts” supporting such information and belief (the sources of the information) must also be alleged. [See Grannis v. Board of Med. Examiners (1971) 19 CA3d 551, 564, 96 CR 863, 873—also dealing with former “good cause” requirement in affidavit for depo subpoena duces tecum] A declaration on “information and belief” cannot be justified by pure speculation (see ¶ 9:60).2) [8:1495.9] Whose declaration: Most declarations are made by the attorney for the moving party, who is usually more familiar with the relevancy and “specific facts” constituting “good cause” for inspection.➪ [8:1495.10] PRACTICE POINTER: Even so, if representing the moving party, be careful about signing such declarations. You risk being called upon (in depositions, for example) to prove the truth of whatever you allege. In turn, this could lead to your being called as a witness at trial and the possibility that this would disqualify you from representing the client.[8:1495.11 - 8:1495.14] Reserved.(5) [8:1495.15] Where ESI sought from source “not reasonably accessible”: Where the responding party has refused to provide electronically-stored information (ESI) on the ground that its source is “not reasonably accessible,” the responding party bears the burden of demonstrating this fact on a motion to compel. [CCP § 2031.310(d); see discussion at ¶ 8:1456.21]Even so, if the demanding party shows “good cause” for discovery, the court may still order the ESI produced on conditions, including allocation of the expense of discovery. [CCP § 2031.310(e), (f); see discussion at ¶ 8:1456.26](6) [8:1496] If “good cause” shown, responding party must justify objections: If “good cause” is shown by the moving party, the burden is then on the responding party to justify any objections made to document disclosure (the same as on motions to compel answers to interrogatories or deposition questions; see ¶ 8:1179). [Kirkland v. Sup.Ct. (Guess?, Inc.) (2002) 95 CA4th 92, 98, 115 CR2d 279, 284]• [8:1496.1] The responding party could not justify refusal to produce a tape recording of conversations with the demanding party on the ground the demanding party knew what he said. The tape recording is discoverable because it is the only accurate and unimpeachable source of what was discussed. [Hartbrodt v. Burke (1996) 42 CA4th 168, 172, 49 CR2d 562, 567](7) [8:1497] Court may order description of documents to be produced: If the CCP § 2031.010 demand is for categories of documents and an objection is made as to certain documents, the court will need an adequate description of the documents in question to make an enforceable order.Therefore, if the responding party objects to an inspection demand, the response must “identify with particularity” any document or thing falling within any category in the demand to which the objection is made, and set forth the specific ground for objection. [CCP § 2031.240(b)] (Comment: Again, general objections are improper and may result in sanctions on a motion to compel.)(8) [8:1497.1] Order discretionary: The court is not required to grant an order for document production. It may properly weigh whatever utility the records are likely to have against the cost, time, expenses and disruption of normal business likely to result from an order compelling production. [Volkswagen of America, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Rusk) (2006) 139 CA4th 1481, 1497, 43 CR3d 723, 733 (citing text); Calcor Space Facility, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Thiem Indus., Inc.)

[See CCP §§ 2031.310(g), 2031.060(f); and discussion at ¶ 8:1456.40 ff.](10) [8:1498] Monetary sanction against losing party: Generally only a monetary sanction against the losing party may be imposed on a motion to compel further responses. If a party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), such sanction “shall” be imposed unless the court finds that party made or opposed the motion “with substantial justification” or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP §§ 2031.310(h) (document production statute), 2023.030(a) (general sanctions statute); see Kravitz v. Sup.Ct. (Milner) (2001) 91 CA4th 1015, 1021, 111 CR2d 385, 389 (citing text)]In addition, when reviewing a sanctions request relating to a request to produce documents, if the court finds that a party, person or attorney did not respond in good faith to the request for production, failed to meet and confer in good faith, or produced requested documents within seven days of a hearing on the motion to compel, the court shall impose sanctions of $1,000 unless it makes written findings that the one subject to the sanction acted “with substantial justification” or other circumstances make imposition of the sanction “unjust.” If an attorney is sanctioned, the court has discretion to order the attorney to report the sanction to the State Bar.

D moved to compel further responses and to compel P to serve a privilege log (which P did before the motion was heard). P’s “boilerplate” objections were sanctionable (e.g., by monetary sanctions). But the sanction could not be a forced waiver of the attorney-client privilege because even “boilerplate” objections were sufficient to preserve the privilege. [Korea Data Systems Co. Ltd. v. Sup.Ct. (Aamazing Technologies Corp.) (1997) 51 CA4th 1513, 1516, 59 CR2d 925, 926; see Catalina Island Yacht Club v. Sup.Ct.

See discussion at ¶ 8:2147 ff.(c) [8:1501] Even inadvertent destruction: Where the responding party inadvertently loses or destroys material evidence, sanctions may be imposed to “even up” the score but not to put the demanding party in a better position than if the evidence had been produced.

P’s expert conducted extensive tests on the shaft, but then inadvertently lost it. The court granted D’s motion to compel production.

(Tri-C Machine Corp.), supra, 171 CA3d at 887, 217 CR at 609, fn. 11]But it was an abuse of discretion to bar P from introducing photographs of the shaft and expert testimony interpreting the photographs because this placed D in a more favorable position than it would have occupied had both the shaft and photographs been available at trial. This was an excessive sanction for the “disobedience” involved. [Puritan Ins. Co. v. Sup.Ct.

Later, Law Firm made an inspection demand for some of these materials, necessary to its defense. Former Client was unable to comply because he had placed the file boxes in commercial storage and they had been destroyed after he failed to pay the storage charges despite repeated warnings from the storage facility. This was tantamount to intentional destruction of the files and ground for a “terminating sanction,” dismissing Former Client’s action against Law Firm. [Williams v.

[CCP § 2031.320](a) [8:1508.1] Requirements: There is no fixed time limit on this motion. And, no “attempt to resolve informally” need be shown. All that has to be shown is the responding party’s failure to comply as agreed. [CCP § 2031.320(a); see Standon Co., Inc. v. Sup.Ct.

Upon concluding the producing party was responsible for the disordered state of the documents produced, the court had discretion to order that party to bear the costs of organizing the documents.

[CCP § 2032.220(a)] “Plaintiff” includes a cross-complainant and “defendant” includes a cross-defendant. [CCP § 2032.210] ➪ [8:1516.1] PRACTICE POINTER: It is defense counsel’s responsibility to obtain plaintiff’s medical records for use by the examining physician—if necessary, by serving a CCP § 2031.010 et seq. demand for inspection of records (see ¶ 8:1435 ff.) or subpoenaing medical records from providers (see ¶ 8:1511) sufficiently in advance of the exam. a. [8:1517] What type of examination: Only a physical examination of the personal injury plaintiff is authorized by demand. [CCP § 2032.220(a)](1) [8:1518] Not mental exams: Even if plaintiff claims “mental suffering and emotional distress” as a result of plaintiff’s personal injury, mental exams are not available on demand. (But a mental exam may be ordered by the court unless plaintiff limits what claims and evidence of mental suffering will be made; see ¶ 8:1567.)(2) [8:1519] Limited to conditions “in controversy”: The physical exam is limited to whatever portion of plaintiff’s body or conditions are “in controversy” in the lawsuit. [CCP § 2032.020(a); see ¶ 8:1551 ff.](3) [8:1519.1] Separate injuries do not entitle defendant to more than one exam: Only a single examination can be obtained on demand despite the variety of injuries claimed.For example, if plaintiff claims both orthopedic and neurologic injuries resulting from the accident, the medical examination will have to cover both. Plaintiff cannot be compelled by demand to submit to separate examinations by an orthopedist and neurologist, absent a stipulation or court order.(a) [8:1519.2] Comment: Because only one examination is permitted, consider postponing it until the plaintiff’s condition has stabilized. See ¶ 8:1558.(4) [8:1520] No “painful, protracted or intrusive” tests: The defendant is entitled only to an examination of plaintiff’s person. This does not include “any diagnostic test or procedure that is painful, protracted, or intrusive.” [CCP § 2032.220(a)(1)](Compare: Such tests might be authorized by court order, although it is unlikely; see ¶ 8:1564.1.)(5) [8:1520.1] Questioning plaintiff regarding medical history? The statute mentions only a “physical examination.” Nothing is said about the right to question the plaintiff regarding plaintiff’s injuries or prior medical history.(a) [8:1520.2] Comment: Although there is no known authority in point, some questioning is obviously essential to the doctor’s examination (e.g., “where does it hurt?”). Beyond this, the scope of permissible questioning is unclear.Examining doctors may properly claim they need to ask about the patient’s entire medical history in order to evaluate other potential causes of the patient’s present condition.On the other hand, the statutory term “physical examination” might not permit questioning as to matters entitled to privacy protection if discovery were sought by other means (e.g., demands for production of plaintiff’s “lifetime medical history”; see ¶ 8:305).Counsel can protect against inappropriate questioning by exercising the right to be present to observe and record the examination. [CCP § 2032.510(a); see ¶ 8:1584](6) [8:1520.3] No vocational examination: Because a vocational examination is not one of the methods for discovery authorized in the Discovery Act (CCP § 2016.010 et seq.), a court may not compel a vocational exam by one who is not a licensed physician (or health care professional). [Browne v. Sup.Ct. (Reeves) (1979) 98 CA3d 610, 615, 159 CR 669, 672—a physical examination cannot be conducted by a “vocational rehabilitation expert”; Haniff v. Sup.Ct. (Hohman) (2017) 9 CA5th 191, 208, 214 CR3d 844, 857] b. [8:1521] Who may demand: “Any defendant” (or cross-defendant) may demand one physical examination of the plaintiff (or cross-complainant) in personal injury cases. [CCP § 2032.220(a)]“The choice of the examining physician generally belongs to the defendant …, although the plaintiff has a right to the presence of counsel during the examination.” [Pratt v. Union Pac. R.R. Co. (2008) 168 CA4th 165, 181, 85 CR3d 321, 334 (internal citation omitted)](1) [8:1522] Each of several defendants? Under the wording of § 2032.220(a) (“any defendant”), each defendant apparently has the right to demand a separate physical examination of plaintiff; i.e., plaintiff arguably may be compelled to submit to as many examinations as there are codefendants.(a) [8:1523] Comment: This may be a “glitch” in the statute. Under former law (requiring a court order for physical exams even in personal injury cases), codefendants were generally limited to a single examination of plaintiff. I.e., they had to agree upon the medical examiner and split the costs. Under the present statute, each defendant apparently can demand a separate examination by its own doctor.However, a protective order would clearly be appropriate to prevent repeated examinations where the injury issues are the same as to each defendant.[8:1524] Reserved.(2) [8:1525] Third-party cross-defendant may demand examination of plaintiff: The statute expressly provides: “As used in this article, plaintiff includes a cross-complainant, and defendant includes a cross-defendant.” [CCP § 2032.210]This apparently allows a third-party cross-defendant to demand a physical exam of the plaintiff as well as of any cross-complainant. (Example: P sues D; D cross-complains for equitable indemnity against joint tortfeasor TP. TP can apparently obtain a physical examination of P on demand.)(a) [8:1526] Comment: This makes sense. A cross-defendant sued for indemnity may have as much at stake as the defendant, and therefore should have as much right to discovery as the defendant. c. [8:1527] When demand may be made: The demand may be made anytime after the defendant has been served or has appeared in the action. (Thus, defendant can demand a medical exam before pleading and while plaintiff’s discovery is still on “hold.”) [CCP § 2032.220(b); see California Shellfish, Inc. v. United Shellfish Co. (1997) 56 CA4th 16, 22, 64 CR2d 797, 800, fn. 5] d. [8:1528] Demand procedure: The procedure is similar to that provided for document inspection under CCP § 2031.010 et seq. (¶ 8:1435 ff.).FORM: Demand for Physical Examination, see Form 8:29 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [8:1529] Content of demand: Defendant’s demand must specify the following:• Date and time of exam (date designated must be at least 30 days after service of demand; see ¶ 8:1530);• Place of exam (within 75 miles of plaintiff’s residence; see ¶ 8:1531);• The examiner’s identity and specialty (see “examiner’s qualifications,” ¶ 8:1532); and• The “manner, conditions, scope and nature of the examination.” [CCP § 2032.220(a)(2), (c) & (d)]Other demands are improper (e.g., demands for “a complete medical history”). Plaintiff may object and refuse compliance (¶ 8:1542).(a) [8:1530] Date of examination vs. date for response: The date designated in the demand must be at least 30 days after service of the demand (extended for the manner of service). The court, on motion, may shorten the time. [CCP §§ 2032.220(d), 2016.050]Note, however, that the plaintiff (responding party) has 20 days within which to respond to the demand (CCP § 2032.230(b); ¶ 8:1543).➪ [8:1530.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Absent some special urgency, it may be advantageous for defense counsel to designate an exam date at least 60 days later than the demand. That way, if plaintiff’s response (20 days after the demand) raises any objections, there is still time to attempt to resolve the matter informally, and to have a motion to compel heard, without rescheduling the exam.(b) [8:1531] Place of examination: The examination must be conducted within 75 miles of plaintiff’s residence. [CCP § 2032.220(a)(2)]• [8:1531.1] Compare: For examinations upon court order, an examinee may be compelled to travel more than 75 miles; see ¶ 8:1577.1.(c) [8:1532] Examiner’s qualifications: The physical exam must be conducted by a licensed physician “or other appropriate licensed health care practitioner.” [CCP § 2032.020(b)]1) [8:1533] “Licensed health care practitioner”: This wording apparently allows chiropractors, optometrists, audiologists, physical therapists, etc. to conduct the examination in “appropriate” cases.2) [8:1534] Comment: Although permissible, this may not be practical. Since defendant has the right to only one examination on demand, it will usually select an examiner with the best possible qualifications—i.e., in most cases, a licensed physician.➪ [8:1535] PRACTICE POINTERS RE SELECTION OF DEFENSE MEDICAL EXAMINER: If you represent defendant and are demanding a medical examination, your choice should reflect the following considerations:• Competence: First of all, choose someone whose credentials are proper for the type of examination required (i.e., a board-certified specialist in most cases).• Clarity: The physician must be able to write reports that can readily be understood by lawyers, judges and insurance claims managers—in short, a report that is intelligible to non-doctors. Reports written in impenetrable jargon or technical verbiage create the impression the doctor is trying to “snow” opposing counsel or the judge, rather than to convey important information. The physician should also be able to testify articulately as an expert witness if the case goes to trial. Many otherwise competent physicians lack these abilities, which diminishes the value of their opinions.• Reliable and prompt: Your medical examiner must be able to keep appointments and prepare reports on time. (The doctor’s canceling the exam or failure to deliver a report within 30 days after the examination could expose you or your client to sanctions; see ¶ 8:1608.) Therefore do not choose doctors who appear to be too busy to meet their commitments. (Doctors who fail to return your telephone calls are not likely to be prompt on other matters.)• Persuading adversary: Most personal injury cases settle before trial. Settlement possibilities are enhanced by selecting a physician whose opinion will be respected by the opposing party. Choosing an “old warhorse” doctor, who does nothing but testify for one side or the other, and who hasn’t treated patients for years, won’t do much for your settlement prospects. The report of a competent, articulate physician who is actively engaged in the treatment of patients will usually be much more helpful.3) [8:1536] Persons assisting examiner: Although the statute does not expressly say so, medical examinations apparently may be conducted by persons working under the general direction of a licensed physician or health care practitioner.• [8:1536.1] Examples: For example, x-ray exams and lab tests may be conducted inside or outside the physician’s office, as long as under the “general direction” of a licensed physician. [See Reuter v. Sup.Ct. (Tag Enterprises) (1979) 93 CA3d 332, 339, 155 CR 525, 530 (decided under former law)][8:1537] Reserved.(d) [8:1538] Conditions of examination: The requirement for specification of the “manner, conditions, scope, and nature of the examination” apparently requires disclosure of whatever diagnostic tests and procedures will be utilized (x-rays, blood and urine samples, etc.). [See CCP § 2032.220(c)]It is not clear if the notice must disclose: e.g., observers who will be present, the examiner’s intent to photograph or videotape the exam.➪ [8:1539] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid problems, make your demand as specific and complete as possible. Ask the physician whom you select as the examiner to write out the tests and procedures the physician proposes to utilize and include these in the demand. Also include names of all other persons who will be present, whether photographs or videotaping is contemplated, etc.(2) [8:1540] Service of demand: Defendant must serve a copy of the demand for physical examination on the plaintiff and on all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2032.220(e)]Personal service under CCP § 1011 is authorized (CCP § 2016.050). If personal service is made to a party’s residence, it must be made between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. If personal service is made to an attorney’s office and no one is in the office, the papers can be left in a conspicuous space between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. [CCP § 1011(a), (b)(1)](3) [8:1541] Not filed with court: As with discovery requests generally, the demanding party retains the original demand and receives the original response. These originals must be retained until 6 months after final disposition of the action. [CCP § 2032.260] e. [8:1542] Plaintiff’s response: Plaintiff is under a duty to respond in writing to defendant’s demand, either by:• Agreeing to it outright; or• Agreeing as modified in the response; or• Refusing to comply for reasons stated in the response. [CCP § 2032.230(a)]FORM: Response to Demand for Physical Examination, see Form 8:30 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1) [8:1542.1] Protective order unnecessary: CCP § 2032.010 et seq. contains no provision for protective orders. But such orders are unnecessary because plaintiffs can simply state their objections to the demand and refuse to be examined. Defendant will then have to move for an order compelling the examination.[8:1542.2] Reserved.(2) [8:1542.3] Agreement upon conditions: Alternatively, plaintiff may respond by agreeing to the examination, but only under designated conditions.➪ [8:1542.4] PRACTICE POINTER: Such response is appropriate where defendant’s demand is too general. For example, in response to a demand for a “complete physical examination,” P might agree to appear for examination upon condition that:• P’s attorney or a representative designated in writing shall be permitted to be present throughout the examination, to take notes and to make an audio recording of the examination (see ¶ 8:1583 ff.);• the physical exam be limited to the specific parts of the body that P has placed in controversy;• the exam consists of those specific procedures set forth in the demand or otherwise agreed to;• no X-rays shall be taken (if P has given the examining physician access to existing X-rays; see ¶ 8:1580 ff.); and• P shall not be questioned by the examining physician or anyone in the physician’s employ other than as to present or past symptoms relating to the injuries which are the subject of this action. (This condition may provoke controversy. See ¶ 8:1520.1 ff.)(3) [8:1543] Time limit for response: Plaintiff’s response is due within 20 days after service of the demand (extended for service by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronically; see CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013, ¶ 9:87 ff.). [CCP §§ 2032.230(b), 2016.050]If the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time limit is extended to the next court day closer to the trial date. [CCP § 2016.060]The court has power to shorten or lengthen the time for plaintiff’s response, but a “motion” (apparently meaning a noticed motion rather than ex parte application) is required. [See CCP § 2032.230(b)](a) [8:1543.1] Delay waives objections: If plaintiff fails to file a timely response, plaintiff waives any objection to the demand. [CCP § 2032.240(a)](b) [8:1543.2] Plaintiff may move for relief from waiver: However, the court on noticed motion may relieve plaintiff from this waiver if it finds:• Plaintiff has now filed a response that “substantially complies” with the statutory requirements; and• Plaintiff’s delay in responding resulted from “mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect.” [CCP § 2032.240(a)][8:1543.3] Reserved.(c) [8:1543.4] No relief under CCP § 473(b): Because the Discovery Act contains specific conditions for relief from waiver, relief cannot be obtained under CCP § 473(b) (which authorizes relief generally for “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”; see ¶ 5:282 ff.).CCP § 473(b) relief is available in discovery proceedings only where there is no analogous provision for relief under the Discovery Act. [See Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1107, 1 CR2d 222, 228, discussed at ¶ 8:10.10]Comment: The significance of course is that it is often easier to obtain relief under CCP § 473(b); see discussion at ¶ 8:10.14 ff.(4) [8:1544] Service of response: Plaintiff’s response must be served on the defendant who demanded the exam, with copies to all other parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2032.230(b)] f. [8:1545] Motion to compel: To enforce compliance with a demand for a defense physical, defendant must file a motion to compel. [CCP §§ 2032.240(b) (motion to compel service of response and compliance), 2032.250(a) (after receipt of response, motion to compel compliance with the demand)](1) [8:1545.1] Where no response: If plaintiff fails to respond at all to the demand, defendant’s remedy is to move for an order compelling a response. [CCP § 2032.240(b)](a) [8:1545.2] No attempt to resolve informally required: Since the motion is for a failure to respond, no showing of a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally is required.➪ [8:1545.2a] PRACTICE POINTER: Even so, it’s usually better practice to call opposing counsel and attempt to get a stipulation. Doing so may save your client the considerable expense involved with a noticed motion.(b) [8:1545.3] Too late for plaintiff to object or refuse? Plaintiff’s failure to timely respond to the demand means any objection thereto is waived (see ¶ 8:1543.1). Thus, unless plaintiff first obtains relief from the waiver (¶ 8:1543.2), plaintiff cannot now raise objections to the examination. The only response plaintiff can make to defendant’s motion is to agree to the examination (perhaps with modifications).(c) [8:1545.4] Monetary sanction against losing party: As with other motions to compel, the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party unless it finds that party had “substantial justification” for its position or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2032.240(c); see ¶ 8:1921 ff.](2) [8:1545.5] For unsatisfactory response: A motion to compel may also lie where plaintiff refuses the demanded examination or agrees only on conditions defendant finds unacceptable. [CCP § 2032.250(a)](a) [8:1545.6] Attempt to resolve informally required: As with discovery motions generally based on disputed responses, the motion must be accompanied by declarations stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the issues informally. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2032.250(a); see discussion at ¶ 8:1158 ff.]1) [8:1545.6a] Opportunity for informal conference in court to resolve dispute: See discussion at ¶ 8:787.1.(b) [8:1545.7] Monetary sanction against losing party: Same as discussed above (¶ 8:1545.4).(3) [8:1545.8] For disobedience to prior orders: Once the court orders plaintiff to respond, or to comply with defendant’s demand for a physical exam, plaintiff risks more severe sanctions for continued refusal to comply. The court may make whatever orders are “just” for disobedience to its order, including “issue,” “evidence” or “terminating” sanctions under CCP § 2023.010 et seq.; and/or additional monetary sanctions.

[8:1603] Examinee’s option to demand copy of examiner’s report: The party being examined (typically, the plaintiff) will normally want a copy of the examiner’s report to gauge settlement prospects and to prepare for trial. The statute provides a mechanism for doing so: The examinee (plaintiff) has the option of demanding in writing that defendant (party at whose instance the examination was conducted) provide the information below (¶ 8:1604). [CCP § 2032.610(a)]Moreover, the examinee is entitled to demand such report even if the examining physician has not prepared one: “The trade-off is clear: If one party to personal injury litigation is required by his or her opponent to submit to a medical examination, at the very least he or she is entitled to a report of the information obtained by the adversary in litigation.” [Kennedy v. Sup.Ct. (Lucky Stores, Inc.) (1998) 64 CA4th 674, 678, 75 CR2d 373, 375](1) [8:1604] What must be provided: If plaintiff so demands, the defendant must provide within 30 days after service of the demand (extended for service by mail) and in no event later than 15 days before trial, the following:• Examiner’s report: “A copy of a detailed written report setting out the history, examinations, findings, including the results of all tests made, diagnoses, prognoses, and conclusions of the examiner”; and• Other reports: “A copy of reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition of the examinee made by that or any other examiner.” [CCP § 2032.610(a) (emphasis added)]➪ [8:1605] PRACTICE POINTER FOR PLAINTIFFS: If your demand specifies less than indicated above (¶ 8:1604), your opponent need not provide anything more. Therefore, if you decide to exercise this option, use the statutory language to make sure you get everything available.➪ [8:1605.1] PRACTICE POINTER FOR DEFENDANTS: Beware of this if you represent defendants. By demanding plaintiff’s physical, you give plaintiff the right to obtain not only the examiner’s report but all earlier reports as well.Defense files may contain candid reports by earlier examiners (e.g., conducted while the claim was being investigated by the insurance carrier) that are devastating to the defense. By turning these over, you will be giving plaintiff a road map to the weaknesses in your case.FORM: Demand for Copy of Report of Medical Exam, see Form 8:33 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(a) [8:1606] No work product protection: Although the examiner’s report and all earlier reports may have been obtained to assist defense counsel in preparation for trial, no work product objection lies. Nor can defense counsel object on this ground to plaintiff’s deposing the medical examiners. [CCP § 2032.610(c); see Kennedy v. Sup.Ct. (Lucky Stores, Inc.), supra, 64 CA4th at 679, 75 CR2d at 375 (citing text)](b) [8:1606.1] Effect of defense “withdrawing” examiner as testifying expert: The examinee’s right to a copy of the examination report is not affected by defendant’s withdrawing the examiner as a testifying expert. That may affect plaintiff’s right to depose the examiner (see ¶ 8:1687.5) but it does not affect the right to a copy of the examiner’s report. [Kennedy v. Sup.Ct. (Lucky Stores, Inc.), supra, 64 CA4th at 678-679, 75 CR2d at 375](c) [8:1606.2] “Examiners” vs. “nonexamining consultants”: The statute requires only that “examiner” reports be exchanged. This presumably does not apply to reports by medical consultants who may have looked at hospital and medical records, x-rays and lab reports, but never examined plaintiff personally. Their reports to defense counsel, whether oral or written, are apparently still protected as work product. [See Queen of Angels Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Jones) (1976) 57 CA3d 370, 374, 129 CR 282, 284—dictum that work product claim sustainable if doctor had not physically examined plaintiff and “merely submitted a hypothetical opinion to counsel based on assumed facts”][8:1606.3] Reserved.1) [8:1606.4] Compare—effect of designation under § 2034.010 et seq.: However, if such “nonexamining consultants” are later designated under CCP § 2034.010 et seq. to testify as expert witnesses at trial, their reports must then be turned over; see ¶ 8:1681.➪ [8:1606.5] PRACTICE POINTER: Some defense counsel are not comfortable relying on the distinction between discovery of reports by “examiners” and “nonexamining consultants.” They therefore instruct even nonexamining consultants to report to them orally—so there will never be a “report” to exchange.However, this is dangerous because if the consultant is later called to testify as an expert witness at trial, the failure to make a written report may undermine the consultant’s credibility. Opposing counsel may forcefully argue that reasonable experts would have made reports and raise questions about the accuracy of the consultant’s memory.(2) [8:1607] Enforcing demand: If defendant (party who obtained the examination) fails to make timely delivery of the examiners’ reports, plaintiff (examinee) may file a motion to compel delivery. [CCP § 2032.620(a)](a) [8:1607.1] Attempt to resolve informally required: The usual declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter outside court must accompany the moving papers. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2032.620(a); see ¶ 8:1158](b) [8:1608] Monetary sanction against losing party: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), a monetary sanction “shall” be imposed against the losing party on the motion to compel unless the court finds “substantial justification” for that party’s position or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2032.620(b); see ¶ 8:1921 ff.](Arguably, the examining party might be able to show it was entirely the fault of the examiner over whom it had no control.)(c) [8:1609] Sanctions for disobeying order: Once an order for delivery of medical reports is made, the full range of discovery sanctions is available if the order is disobeyed. The court may impose whatever sanctions are “just,” including:• “Issue,” “evidence” or “terminating” sanctions against the examining party; or• Monetary sanctions in addition to or in lieu of the above. [CCP § 2032.620(c); and see CCP § 2023.030(b)-(d), discussed at ¶ 8:2175 ff.](Arguably, a contempt sanction could also be imposed if “just”; but § 2032.620(c) et seq. does not expressly so provide.)(d) [8:1610] Examiner’s testimony barred: Whether or not any other sanction is imposed, an examiner whose report has not been furnished in response to court order will not be permitted to testify at trial: “The court shall exclude at trial the testimony of any health care practitioner whose report has not been provided by a party ordered to do so by the court.” [CCP § 2032.650(c) (emphasis added)]Effect: Unless other examinations are permitted, the examining party will be without qualified expert testimony. b. [8:1611] Demand entitles examining party to examinee’s reports: Plaintiff’s demand for and obtaining copies of the defense medical examiner’s report has two significant consequences:• It entitles defendant to receive in exchange (simultaneously) copies of all medical reports by the plaintiff’s doctors and experts; and• It waives any privilege or work product protection that otherwise would protect such reports from discovery. [CCP § 2032.630; see ¶ 8:254 ff.](1) [8:1612] Impact—reports must be turned over: In the usual personal injury case, it would be foolhardy for plaintiff’s counsel not to request a copy of the defense medical report. But doing so ends any claim of “privilege” or “work product” protecting the reports or testimony of plaintiff’s doctors. (The doctor-patient privilege is waived in personal injury cases in any event; Ev.C. §§ 996, 1016.)(a) [8:1613] No work product protection: Thus, even reports of doctors and experts who have examined plaintiff on a consultant basis (not to testify at trial), and whose reports would otherwise be protected as “attorney’s work product,” become discoverable by the defense. [CCP § 2032.630; see Queen of Angels Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Jones) (1976) 57 CA3d 370, 374-375, 129 CR 282, 285](b) [8:1613.1] Reports by nonexamining consultants? But, presumably, reports by consultants who have not examined plaintiff, and who base their opinions solely on review of medical history, x-rays, hypothetical facts, etc., are still protected “work product.” [See Queen of Angels Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Jones), supra, 57 CA3d at 374, 129 CR at 284; and ¶ 8:1606.2](2) [8:1614] Future reports must also be delivered: The examinee is under a duty promptly to exchange copies of all existing reports plus any later reports relating to the same condition by the same or any other examiners. The waiver of privilege and work product protection also applies to these later reports. [CCP §§ 2032.630, 2032.640](3) [8:1615] Deposing examiner has same result: The examinee cannot avoid the exchange and waiver of any claim of privilege or work product by deposing the examiner instead of demanding the examiner’s report. Deposing the examiner has the same effect. [CCP § 2032.630](a) [8:1615.1] Limitation: This rule does not apply to depositions conducted after the examiner has been designated as a trial witness under CCP § 2034.210 et seq. (At that late stage, if the examinee has not previously demanded the examiner’s report—which is almost unthinkable—deposing the examiner will not obligate the examinee to exchange reports.) [CCP § 2032.630](4) [8:1615.2] Disclosure of examiner’s underlying raw data: There is no express statutory authority permitting (or barring) transmission of underlying data. However, upon a showing of demonstrated need, the court may order disclosure of “raw data and audio recording [of a neuropsychological examination] to plaintiffs’ attorney subject to a protective order.” [Randy’s Trucking, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Buttram) (2023) 91 CA5th 818, 834-835, 842, 308 CR3d 645, 657-658, 664](5) [8:1616] No duty to disclose identity of examinee’s doctors if no written report made: The Discovery Act allows plaintiffs to conceal the identity of doctors who examined them but made no written reports. I.e., plaintiff is required to exchange written reports (then existing or later produced) by any examining doctor. But the identity of examining doctors who did not submit a report is still protected “work product.” [CCP § 2032.630](a) [8:1616.1] Purpose: This protects plaintiffs from having to disclose examining doctors who expressed unfavorable opinions informally. It prevents defendants from utilizing such disclosures to argue that “plaintiff’s ‘own doctor’ denied there was any injury,” etc.➪ [8:1616.2] PRACTICE POINTER: The moral is clear: If you represent plaintiffs, ask any examining doctor to call you BEFORE making a written report. If the doctor’s oral evaluation is negative, instruct the doctor not to make a written report. That way, the doctor’s identity will remain protected as “work product” (¶ 8:246) and the unfavorable evaluation will not return to haunt you later on. [See Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser (1999) 22 C4th 31, 37, 91 CR2d 293, 298 (citing text)]On the other hand, if the opinion is favorable, you will certainly want a written report; and you will probably want to show it to defendant (e.g., for settlement purposes).(b) [8:1616.3] Comment: There is no real risk of “surprise” to defendants here. Plaintiff is not going to call a witness whose opinion is unfavorable. In any event, defendants can avoid any “surprise” by serving a CCP § 2034.210 et seq. expert witness demand before trial.(6) [8:1617] Enforcing exchange: If plaintiff (examinee) fails to exchange reports as stated above (¶ 8:1611 ff.), the defendant’s (examining party’s) remedy is to move for an order compelling the examinee to do so. [CCP § 2032.650(a)](a) [8:1617.1] Attempt to resolve informally required: The usual declaration stating facts showing “a reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter informally must accompany the motion. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2032.650(a); see ¶ 8:1158 ff.](b) [8:1618] Monetary sanction against losing party: A monetary sanction “shall” be imposed against the losing party unless the court finds “substantial justification” for that party’s position or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2032.650(b); see ¶ 8:1921 ff.](c) [8:1619] Sanctions for disobeying order: If after an order to compel is granted, the examinee still fails to deliver copies of examinee’s reports, the full range of discovery sanctions is available for disobeying the court’s order: i.e., an “issue,” “evidence” or “terminating” sanction against the examinee. [CCP § 2032.650(c); see ¶ 8:2145 ff.]1) [8:1620] Testimony excluded: Moreover, regardless of whether any other sanction is imposed, “[t]he court shall exclude at trial the testimony of any health care practitioner whose report has not been provided by a party.” [CCP § 2032.650(c) (emphasis added)][8:1621] Comment: By itself, however, this is not much of a sanction. For example, if plaintiff holds back a written report because it is unfavorable, excluding the doctor’s testimony at trial is no real sanction because plaintiff would not call this doctor as a witness in any event.[8:1622 - 8:1623] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.

[8:1643] No right to serve demand prior to trial setting(1) [8:1644] “Good cause” for early disclosurec. [8:1645] Compare—after mistrial, new trial or reversal on appealA demand for exchange of expert witness information may be made any time after the case is initially set for trial. The deadline for the demand is 10 days after the initial trial date has been set or 70 days before that trial date, whichever is later. [CCP § 2034.220] If the last day falls on a weekend or holiday, the time limit is extended to the next court day closer to the trial date. [CCP § 2016.060] Compare—under case management rules: In some courts, the demand requirement is dispensed with under local case management rules. Instead, the court proposes dates for expert witness disclosure and discovery at a case management conference and the parties are bound by their stipulation to those dates. See further discussion at ¶ 8:1630. a. [8:1642] Relief for untimely demand: The Discovery Act does not expressly authorize a court to shorten or lengthen the deadline for serving a demand for exchange of expert witness information. (It does, however, authorize the court to alter the time for the exchange of information pursuant to such demand; see ¶ 8:1663.)Because the Discovery Act is silent on this matter, relief from the CCP § 2034.230 deadline may be obtained under CCP § 473(b) (which authorizes courts generally to grant relief from any “judgment, dismissal, order, or other proceeding” on a showing of “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect”; see ¶ 5:282 ff.). [Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1107, 1 CR2d 222, 228](1) [8:1642.1] Example: D’s demand for expert witness exchange was four days premature. (D erroneously thought a local rule requiring earlier demand applied to the case.) P filed “objections” to D’s demand as untimely. D’s motion for relief under CCP § 473(b) was properly granted and P ordered to respond even though the demand was untimely. [Zellerino v. Brown, supra, 235 CA3d at 1107, 1 CR2d at 228] b. [8:1643] No right to serve demand prior to trial setting: CCP § 2034.210 authorizes a demand for exchange of expert witness information only “[a]fter the setting of the initial trial date.” [CCP § 2034.210 (emphasis added)]This “evinces a legislative preference” for the time when such disclosure is to be made. [See South Tahoe Pub. Utility Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (CH2M Hill Calif., Inc.) (1979) 90 CA3d 135, 139, 154 CR 1, 3 (involving similar provision in former statute)]Thus, there is no right to serve a demand for exchange of expert witness information prior to trial setting. (And there would be no advantage either, because no exchange is due under CCP § 2034.230(b) until 50 days before trial; see ¶ 8:1660.) [County of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Martinez) (1990) 224 CA3d 1446, 1456, 274 CR 712, 719—no right to discover opinions of consultants not yet designated as testifying experts](1) [8:1644] “Good cause” for early disclosure: But a court may order early discovery from an opposing expert based on a showing of “good cause,” which may exist where:• so many experts are likely to be called that it will be difficult to depose them within the limited period after an exchange of expert witness information; or• the party seeking discovery cannot obtain the information elsewhere and therefore is unable to prepare its claim or defense; or• the party seeking discovery is resisting a summary judgment motion based on the expert’s opinion and a legitimate question exists regarding the foundation for that opinion. [See Hernandez v. Sup.Ct. (Acheson Indus., Inc.) (2003) 112 CA4th 285, 298, 4 CR3d 883, 894] c. [8:1645] Compare—after mistrial, new trial or reversal on appeal: A mistrial, new trial or reversal of the judgment on appeal automatically restarts the time limitations on discovery (see ¶ 8:451 ff.). In such cases, a demand for an expert witness exchange is timely if made 70 days before the date set for retrial. [Beverly Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Castaneda) (1993) 19 CA4th 1289, 1295, 24 CR2d 238, 241]If the retrial is scheduled within the 70-day period, a party may move for relief from the time limit “just as in any other case.” [Beverly Hosp. v. Sup.Ct. (Castaneda), supra, 19 CA4th at 1296, 24 CR2d at 242]• [8:1645.1] Alternatively, a party may file a motion for leave to designate different expert witnesses for the retrial. Providing ample time remains to depose the new witnesses, it is an abuse of discretion to refuse permission. [Guzman v. Sup.Ct. (Lee) (1993) 19 CA4th 705, 708, 23 CR2d 585, 586][8:1646] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business. No Claim to Orig. U.S. Govt.

[8:1652] Service of demandd. [8:1653] Custody of demand and information exchangedFirst of all, a demand for exchange of expert witness information is optional, not mandatory. (See “Strategies and Tactics re Demands for Exchange of Expert Witness Information,” ¶ 8:1636 ff.) However, once a demand is served by any party, all parties are obligated to exchange such information. [CCP § 2034.260(a), ¶ 8:1640] FORM: Demand for Exchange of Information Concerning Expert Witnesses, see Form 8:34 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG). Compare—under case management rules: See discussion at ¶ 8:1641. a. [8:1648] Form of demand: The demand must be in writing. The name of the party making the demand must appear below the title of the case. [CCP § 2034.230(a)]Note that § 2034.230 does not expressly require that the demand be signed by anyone. b. [8:1649] Content of demand: The demand must specify:(1) [8:1649.1] Statement designating Civil Discovery Act: First of all, the expert witness demand must state that it is being made under Chapter 18 of the Civil Discovery Act (CCP § 2034.210 et seq.). [CCP § 2034.230(a)](2) [8:1649.2] Date when exchange to be made: It must also state the date on which the required information is to be exchanged. That date must be 20 days after service of the demand, or 50 days before trial, whichever is later. (As discussed below (¶ 8:1663), the court has power to modify this date.) [CCP § 2034.230(b)](a) [8:1649.3] Extension for service by mail, etc.: The time for performing acts is extended where a discovery demand or notice is served by mail, overnight delivery or fax or electronic service. [See CCP §§ 1010.6(a)(3), 1013(a); see ¶ 9:87 ff.]Thus, if an expert witness demand is served by mail, the exchange date based on service (20 days after service) must be extended accordingly (i.e., 5 calendar days for mail within California, 10 calendar days for mailing to or from outside the state, etc.). [See Staub v. Kiley (2014) 226 CA4th 1437, 1446, 173 CR3d 104, 110 (citing text)](b) [8:1649.4] Effect of premature date? A problem arises where the demand specifies a premature date for the exchange (e.g., does not include the extension required for service by mail). The court clearly has power, upon motion for protective order, to change the date for the exchange (see ¶ 8:1654 ff.). Absent court intervention, however, it is not clear whether specifying a premature date invalidates the demand. [See Staub v. Kiley, supra, 226 CA4th at 1446, 173 CR3d at 110 (citing text)]In one case, however, the court held that by specifying a premature exchange date in the demand, a party failed to make a “complete and timely compliance” with the expert witness list exchange requirements and thus, under CCP § 2034.300, lacked standing to seek exclusion of expert witnesses at trial who were not timely designated by the opposing party. [Staub v. Kiley, supra, 226 CA4th at 1446, 173 CR3d at 111; and see discussion of testimony exclusion sanction at ¶ 8:1708 ff.]➪ [8:1649.5] PRACTICE POINTER: Courts favor exchange of expert witness information in substantial compliance with the statutory requirements and dislike “gamesmanship”; so, don’t count on the court excusing your noncompliance based on the fact the disclosure date stated in the demand is “premature.”(3) [8:1650] May also include demand for reports: The demand may also require “the mutual and simultaneous production for inspection and copying of all discoverable reports and writings” of experts employed by the parties. [CCP § 2034.210(c) (emphasis added)] (However, including such demand obligates the demanding party to exchange reports; see ¶ 8:1681.)➪ [8:1651] PRACTICE POINTER: If you’re going to make a demand for exchange of expert witness information, it’s a good idea to include a demand for the opposing expert’s reports and writings. While only “discoverable” reports and writings need be produced, opposing counsel may not want to risk withholding any documents, so you could end up with the expert’s entire file. You may find memoranda, notes or even correspondence with opposing counsel disclosing strengths and weaknesses of the opposing party’s case.➪ [8:1651.1] PRACTICE POINTER: Conversely, before listing any expert with whom you have consulted, review the expert’s file to make sure you won’t be handing over tools for your self-destruction.Because of the risk here, some lawyers avoid written communications with experts whom they plan to designate under § 2034.260(b)(1). That way, there are no “discoverable reports and writings” to exchange. (The offsetting risk, however, is that your expert’s failure to make a written report may affect the credibility of the expert’s testimony at trial; see ¶ 8:1685.1.) c. [8:1652] Service of demand: A copy of the demand must be served on all parties who have appeared in the action. [CCP § 2034.240] d. [8:1653] Custody of demand and information exchanged: Neither the demand nor the expert witness information exchanged pursuant thereto are filed with the court. [CCP § 2034.290(a); CRC 3.250(a)(13)-(16)]Rather, the originals (with proof of service) are retained by the demanding party until 6 months after final disposition of the action. [CCP § 2034.290(b)]If their contents become relevant to an issue in the action, these documents “shall be lodged with the court” pending determination of that issue. (For example, to enable the trial judge to rule on an objection to expert testimony for failure to comply with enumerated statutory disclosure duties; see ¶ 8:1708 ff.)

[8:1659.1] Who must exchange: The expert witness disclosure process is a “two-way street”: All parties who have appeared in the action are under a duty to exchange information as described below (¶ 8:1664 ff.). [CCP § 2034.260(a)] b. [8:1660] When exchange due: The exchange must be made on or before the date specified in the demand, which must be 20 days after service of the demand (extended for the manner of service, see ¶ 8:1649.3) or 50 days before the initial trial, whichever is later. [CCP § 2034.230(b); see ¶ 8:1649.2]Compare—under case management rules: See discussion at ¶ 8:1641.[8:1661 - 8:1662] Reserved.(1) [8:1663] Court may change date: On motion for “good cause shown,” the court may order the exchange on an earlier or later date. [CCP § 2034.230(b)](Compare: However, the court has no power to alter the deadline for serving the demand for exchange of expert witness information; ¶ 8:1642.) c. [8:1664] How exchange made: The exchange of expert witness information may occur either at a meeting of the attorneys involved or by serving the information by any method specified in CCP § 1011 or § 1013 on or before the date set for the exchange. [CCP § 2034.260(a)](1) [8:1665] “Simultaneous” exchange required: To prevent either party from taking advantage, the exchange of expert witness lists and documents is to be “simultaneous.” [CCP § 2034.210]A party may not merely file a document “reserving the right to designate witnesses in response to the other party’s disclosure.” The party filing such a document may be precluded from calling expert witnesses at trial. [Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 CA4th 1019, 1026-1027, 41 CR3d 850, 855-856—defendant delayed designation of his retained expert witnesses until 20 days after plaintiff had designated his expert, violating “simultaneous” exchange requirement]Caution: Exchanges by mail may limit time available for designation of supplemental experts since the need for such experts will not be known until the opposing expert list is received (see ¶ 8:1687).➪ [8:1665.1] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid the delay in mailing, it is usually to everyone’s advantage to stipulate that expert designations and reports will be hand delivered, faxed or served electronically on the exchange date. d. [8:1666] What information must be exchanged: The following information must be exchanged by each party:(1) [8:1667] Experts list: A list setting forth the name and address of each person whose expert opinion that party expects to offer at trial by live or deposition testimony (or a statement that the party does not presently intend to offer any expert testimony). [CCP § 2034.260(b)(1), (2); see Kalaba v. Gray (2002) 95 CA4th 1416, 1419, 116 CR2d 570, 576]Note: There is no requirement that the list be signed by the attorney or anyone else.(a) [8:1667.1] Includes treating physicians: Attending physicians are almost always asked to express opinions as to their patients’ conditions (e.g., diagnosis, prognosis, etc.). Therefore, the physicians’ names and addresses usually must be included on the list. [CCP § 2034.260(b)(1)] (But expert witness declarations are not required as to treating physicians; see ¶ 8:1668a ff.)• [8:1667.1a] An expert witness list designating “all past or present examining and/or treating physicians” (without giving their names and addresses) does not comply with the above requirements (¶ 8:1667). The court may exclude testimony by the nondesignated doctors. [Kalaba v. Gray, supra, 95 CA4th at 1418, 116 CR2d at 576]1) [8:1667.2] Comment: By the time of the expert witness exchange, defendants usually will have deposed all of plaintiff’s treating physicians. [See Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser (1999) 22 C4th 31, 38, 91 CR2d 293, 299]But there are cases in which it may be “both unnecessary and prohibitively expensive” to depose all of the treating and examining physicians (e.g., medical malpractice cases). For this reason, the patient’s expert witness list must designate which of the treating physicians the patient intends to call as an expert at trial. [See Kalaba v. Gray (2002) 95 CA4th 1416, 1423, 116 CR2d 570, 576—18 nonparty physicians on witness list](b) [8:1667.3] Local rules may limit number of experts: Some courts have rules limiting the number of experts that may be designated. [See San Diego Sup.Ct. Rule 2.1.11—“It is the policy of the court that parties are limited to one expert per field of expertise per side … absent a court order to the contrary” (emphasis added)]Comment: This appears to be a trial rule rather than a rule governing discovery and therefore not subject to CRC 3.20(a) (which generally preempts local rules governing pleadings, discovery, etc.; see ¶ 9:13.2).(c) [8:1667.4] Court may limit number of experts: The court may, “at any time before or during the trial,” limit the number of experts to be called by any party. [Ev.C. § 723 (emphasis added)]Comment: Presumably, this empowers the court to limit the number of witnesses to be designated in response to a demand for exchange of expert witness information. Alternatively, a party may seek a § 2034.250 protective order where an opponent designates an oppressively large number of experts (see ¶ 8:1654 ff.).(2) [8:1668] Expert witness declaration: In addition, an “expert witness declaration” (prepared and signed by the attorney, ¶ 8:1668.3) must be attached, which provides information about each expert designated who is either:— a party to the action;— an employee of a party;— or “retained by a party” for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion. [CCP § 2034.210(b) (emphasis added)]Effect: It thus becomes essential to determine the status of each expert designated in the expert witness list. Nothing more than name and address is required for “independent” experts or percipient witnesses (e.g., treating physicians; see ¶ 8:1668a). But far more detailed information must be provided for experts who are parties or employees or who have been retained to testify. (Note also that the party retaining an expert to testify must produce the expert for deposition; see ¶ 8:1688.) [Huntley v. Foster (1995) 35 CA4th 753, 756, 41 CR2d 358, 360 (citing text)](a) [8:1668a] Not applicable to nonparty treating physician: A nonparty treating physician must be listed on the experts list (¶ 8:1667.1), but no expert witness declaration is required. Such a declaration is required only for an expert who is “a party or an employee of a party, or has been retained by a party for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion.” [CCP § 2034.210(b) (emphasis added); see Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser (1999) 22 C4th 31, 39, 91 CR2d 293, 300—nonparty treating physician for whom no expert witness declaration submitted could testify as to his opinion re causation of injury; Ochoa v. Dorado (2014) 228 CA4th 120, 139, 174 CR3d 889, 903]The fact that the treating physician is a percipient witness “does not mean that his testimony is limited only to personal observations. Rather, like any other expert, he may provide both fact and opinion testimony.” [Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser, supra, 22 C4th at 35, 91 CR2d at 297 (emphasis added); see Ochoa v. Dorado, supra, 228 CA4th at 139, 174 CR3d at 904]1) [8:1668b] Scope of opinion testimony: The expert witness treating physician is not limited to opinion testimony based on observations and treatment of plaintiff. Rather, “he may testify as to any opinions formed on the basis of facts independently acquired and informed by his training, skill, and experience. This may well include opinions regarding causation and standard of care because such issues are inherent in a physician’s work.” [Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser, supra, 22 C4th at 39, 91 CR2d at 300 (emphasis added); see Ochoa v. Dorado, supra, 228 CA4th at 140, 174 CR3d at 905—includes opinion re reasonable value of services treating physician provided]But a treating physician may not offer testimony at trial that exceeds the scope of the physician’s deposition testimony if the opposing party had no notice that the expert would offer new testimony in sufficient time to re-depose the expert. [Dozier v. Shapiro (2011) 199 CA4th 1509, 1523, 133 CR3d 142, 155—trial court properly excluded treating physician’s testimony on standard of care where physician was not designated to testify on that topic and indicated at deposition that he had not formed an opinion on that issue; see also ¶ 8:1718.1]2) [8:1668c] Declaration may be required if additional work done by treating physician: A treating physician may become a retained expert where counsel supplies the physician with additional information (such as copies of pleadings or another physician’s medical records for review) and asks the physician to testify to opinions formed on the basis of that additional information. [Belfiore-Braman v. Rotenberg (2018) 25 CA5th 234, 245, 235 CR3d 629, 637-638]In that event, the treating physician must be included in the expert witness declaration.➪ [8:1668d] PRACTICE POINTER FOR DEFENDANTS: When deposing a treating physician, be sure to ask whether the physician holds any opinions on causation and standard of care; and if so, on what facts those opinions are based. Conceivably, some treating physicians may ultimately become defense witnesses. [See Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser, supra, 22 C4th at 39, 91 CR2d at 300](b) [8:1668.1] Whose expert: An expert witness declaration is required for each expert “retained by a party,” not necessarily the designating party. Thus, if the designating party intends to rely on experts produced by other parties (e.g., codefendants), the designating party must furnish an expert witness declaration for those experts. [Zellerino v. Brown (1991) 235 CA3d 1097, 1116, 1 CR2d 222, 234 (citing text)—by listing the experts of her opponent, P assumed burden of providing declarations as to their expected testimony]1) [8:1668.2] Comment: Usually, this is done by obtaining information from the party employing that expert. If this is not possible, the designating party may need to seek a protective order; see ¶ 8:1655.1.(c) [8:1668.3] Whose declaration: The “expert witness declaration” must be signed by the designating party’s attorney (not by the expert).(d) [8:1668.4] Contents: The expert witness declaration must contain the following information:• Qualifications: A brief statement of the expert’s qualifications;• “General substance of expected testimony”: A brief narrative statement of the general substance of the testimony that the expert is expected to give (¶ 8:1669 ff.);• Ready to testify: Representations that the expert:— has agreed to testify at trial; and— will be sufficiently familiar with the pending action to provide a meaningful oral deposition concerning the specific testimony the expert is expected to give at trial (including any opinion and its basis) (¶ 8:1673);• Costs and fees: A statement of the expert’s hourly and daily fee for providing deposition testimony and for consulting with the retaining attorney. [CCP § 2034.260(c)]An expert called to give deposition testimony by an opposing party is entitled to charge the expert’s regular rate for deposition work, provided it is a reasonable fee. Further, the fee cannot exceed what the expert has charged or will charge the expert’s own client for testimonial work. [CCP § 2034.430(d); Gov.C. § 68092.5; see Rancho Bernardo Develop. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Oaks North Villas Condominium Ass’n) (1992) 2 CA4th 358, 363, 2 CR2d 878, 881] Effect: If the party designating the expert has a “wholesale rate” from the expert, the other party gets the benefit. FORM: Expert Witness Declaration, see Form 8:35 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).1) [8:1668.5] Qualifications: Expert witness declarations should provide enough information to enable the opposing party to gauge the credibility of the opinion testimony. Thus, the declarations should normally cover such matters as:• area of expertise;• relevant education;• relevant employment or experience; and• professional society memberships, publications and honors.➪ [8:1668.6] PRACTICE POINTER: Many experts have professional resumes containing all of this information. Ask for one and attach it to the declaration.2) [8:1669] “General substance of expected testimony” requirement: To be meaningful, enough facts and opinions should be disclosed to enable the opposing party to determine whether to depose the expert, and to prepare for cross-examination and rebuttal at trial. [See Bonds v. Roy (1999) 20 C4th 140, 146-147, 83 CR2d 289, 293; Valencia v. Mendoza (2024) 103 CA5th 427, 449, 322 CR3d 903, 920]a) [8:1670] Correct legal terms not required: The “general substance” standard does not require that the expert’s opinion be expressed in strict legal terms. [See Castaneda v. Bornstein (1995) 36 CA4th 1818, 1828, 43 CR2d 10, 17 (disapproved on other grounds by Bonds v. Roy (1999) 20 C4th 140, 149, 83 CR2d 289, 294, fn. 4)—declaration said expert would testify on matters “leading to” infant’s death: this was sufficient to put opposing party on notice expert would testify on both breach of duty and causation]b) [8:1671] General description may suffice: Even rather general descriptions of the expert’s proposed testimony may be held sufficient. E.g., “medical care and treatment rendered … [and] diagnoses and prognoses of plaintiff’s physical condition.” [Sprague v. Equifax, Inc. (1985) 166 CA3d 1012, 1040, 213 CR 69, 87 (decided under former statute with identical language)]However, the description must be sufficiently broad and detailed so the testimony at trial clearly comes within its scope.[8:1672] Reserved.3) [8:1673] Representation that expert be ready to testify: The expert witness declaration must state that each expert listed is familiar with the case and ready to be deposed—i.e., that the expert is (or will be) sufficiently familiar with the case to provide a “meaningful oral deposition” concerning any opinion and its basis. [CCP § 2034.260(c)(4)][8:1674] Reserved.a) [8:1675] Purpose: This provision makes counsel “vouch” for the experts listed, thus minimizing any risk parties might designate more experts than they truly intend to call and thereby make it very expensive for opponents to depose everyone on the list to find out which of the designated experts really are going to testify. In effect, pursuant to CCP § 2034.260(c)(4), counsel must guarantee that the designated experts have been contacted and are prepared to testify. Counsel risk sanctions personally if these representations prove inaccurate.(e) [8:1676] Effect of inadequate disclosure: Inadequate disclosure of the “general substance of expected testimony” is grounds for exclusion of the expert’s testimony at trial under CCP § 2034.300 (see ¶ 8:1717.1 ff.).(f) [8:1677] Effect of erroneous disclosure: Although CCP § 2034.010 et seq. do not address the matter, the court has power under CCP § 2023.010 to sanction a party who provides inaccurate information in its expert witness exchange. It need not be shown that the errors were willful. [Kohan v. Cohan (1991) 229 CA3d 967, 969, 280 CR 474, 475]• [8:1678] D’s expert witness list included an expert who had died 2 years earlier. P moved to exclude that expert’s declaration at trial and for evidentiary and monetary sanctions. Even though D’s error was not willful, monetary sanctions were proper because P was required to expend unnecessary efforts. [Kohan v. Cohan, supra, 229 CA3d at 969, 280 CR at 475][8:1679 - 8:1680] Reserved.(3) [8:1681] Discoverable reports: In addition, if the expert witness demand included a demand for exchange of discoverable reports and writings (see ¶ 8:1650 ff.), all parties must exchange “all discoverable reports and writings,” if any, made by that expert in the course of preparing an opinion. These reports are to be exchanged together with the expert list and declarations at the place and on the date specified in the demand. [CCP § 2034.270]Parties may also attempt to obtain expert-related documents pursuant to a notice of deposition under CCP § 2025.220; if they do, the materials, including ESI, must be produced at least 3 business days before the deposition. [CCP § 2034.415]It is therefore necessary to consider which reports are discoverable and which may still be protected as “work product.”(a) [8:1682] Reports “in capacity of expert witness” discoverable: See ¶ 8:256.(b) [8:1683] Consultants’ “advisory” reports still protected as work product: See ¶ 8:257.(c) [8:1684] Potential impeachment as “good cause” for discovery of advisory reports: See ¶ 8:258.(d) [8:1685] Three-step analysis required to determine discoverability: See ¶ 8:264.➪ [8:1685.1] PRACTICE POINTER: To avoid exchanging “discoverable reports and writings,” some litigators instruct their experts not to prepare a formal report. This avoids giving the other side ammunition for cross-examination.But there is a downside to this practice: You may need a written report for settlement purposes. And, if the case goes to trial, your opponent may be able to convince the jury that any responsible expert would have prepared a formal report, so that the absence of a report undermines your expert’s credibility.(e) [8:1685.2] Effect of incomplete disclosure? The expert’s testimony may be excluded at time of trial if the court finds the reports withheld were discoverable. [CCP § 2034.300(c)]But the procedure to compel production before trial is unclear: There is no motion to compel provision in § 2034.010 et seq.; and the protective orders provision is aimed at “burdensome demands” rather than incomplete responses.1) [8:1685.3] Comment: If the report’s existence is known before trial, it can be subpoenaed for production at the expert’s deposition. But that might lead to “work product” objections, necessitating a motion to compel.[8:1685.4] Reserved.(f) [8:1685.5] Reports created after exchange date: Nothing in the Discovery Act requires experts to refrain from creating new or additional reports or writings after the specified date, or to voluntarily disclose them. The detailed statutory procedures for exchanging expert witness information omit any such requirement. [Boston v. Penny Lane Ctrs., Inc. (2009) 170 CA4th 936, 952, 88 CR3d 707, 720]Nevertheless, if it appears that the opposing party is trying to manipulate the expert witness discovery rules by delaying production of such reports, the court may find the failure to produce them was unreasonable and exclude opinions contained in them. [See Boston v. Penny Lane Ctrs., Inc., supra, 170 CA4th at 952, 88 CR3d at 721]➪ [8:1685.6] PRACTICE POINTERS: If your expert prepares a report after the date specified for exchange, promptly provide a copy to opposing counsel. And, if the report is prepared after your expert has been deposed, immediately offer to submit your expert to a second deposition at your expense. Failure to do so significantly increases the risk that your expert will not be permitted to testify as to matters in the late report. [See Boston v. Penny Lane Ctrs., Inc. (2009) 170 CA4th 936, 952-953, 88 CR3d 707, 721—fact that counsel provided expert’s reports “within about a day” of receiving them was factor in court’s determination that counsel acted reasonably and in permitting expert to testify]Also, consider asking the court at the final status conference to order all parties to produce any expert reports not previously produced. And, when starting to cross-examine an opposing expert at trial, consider asking whether the expert produced any reports after the exchange date. e. [8:1686] Supplemental expert witness lists: Sometimes, the exchange reveals that one party plans to call experts on subjects the opposing party assumed would not require expert testimony. In such cases, the opposing party has the right to supplement its expert witness exchange by adding experts to cover subjects on which the other party indicates it plans to offer expert testimony, and on which the opposing party had not previously retained an expert to testify. [CCP § 2034.280(a); see Fairfax v. Lords (2006) 138 CA4th 1019, 1025, 41 CR3d 850, 854-855; Du-All Safety, LLC v. Sup.Ct. (Krein) (2019) 34 CA5th 485, 498, 246 CR3d 211, 219 (quoting text)](1) [8:1686.1] Limited to new subjects raised by another party: The “supplemental” list is for experts on subjects not included in the party’s original exchange that have been raised by another party. [CCP § 2034.280(a)]Thus, a supplemental list cannot be used to:— add experts on subjects designated by the party in the original exchange;— add experts on new subjects not raised by an opposing party’s designation; or— substitute for an already-designated expert. [CCP § 2034.280(a); see Basham v. Babcock (1996) 44 CA4th 1717, 1723, 52 CR2d 456, 460—party unhappy with designated expert’s deposition testimony could not call supplementally-named expert to testify on same subjects at trial]Compare: To add an expert on an already-designated subject or to replace an expert, a motion to augment or amend must be brought; see discussion at ¶ 8:1739 ff.(2) [8:1686.2] Comment: Unlike federal practice, there are no specially designated rebuttal experts in state court. Experts on the supplemental list are not “rebuttal” experts; rather, they testify as the originally designated experts do. The ability of an expert to rebut the other side’s experts is unaffected by whether the expert was disclosed initially or in a supplemental list.(3) [8:1687] Procedure: Within 20 days after the original exchange of information, any party may serve:• A “supplemental expert witness list” containing the names and addresses of experts who will testify on the subject designated by the other party;• An “expert witness declaration” (see ¶ 8:1668) for each such supplemental expert employed or retained by a party; and• Discoverable reports and writings, if any, made by such supplemental expert. [CCP § 2034.280]Caution: The 20 days apparently run from the date of the exchange; and where the exchange is by mail, this means the date of mailing, not receipt. So, you may have fewer than 20 days within which to find, interview and employ a supplemental expert.(4) [8:1687.1] Depositions after “cut-off”: The party serving such a list must make the experts available for deposition “immediately”—even if the 15-day deadline for deposing experts (see ¶ 8:1690 ff.) has expired. [CCP § 2034.280(c)][8:1687.2 - 8:1687.4] Reserved. f. [8:1687.5] Right to withdraw designated expert: Sometimes, a designated expert reverses an opinion (or starts “waffling”) before deposition or trial. The party designating the expert has the right to withdraw the expert simply by “amending” its list pursuant to CCP § 2034.260(b)-(c). No prior notice or leave of court is required. [County of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Hernandez) (1990) 222 CA3d 647, 656, 271 CR 698, 704]Any privileged information communicated to the expert is protected as long as the expert was withdrawn before a significant part of the information was disclosed. I.e., designation of the expert as an expected trial witness is not itself an implied waiver of the privilege. [Shooker v. Sup.Ct. (Winnick) (2003) 111 CA4th 923, 930, 4 CR3d 334, 339-340—party had previously designated himself as testifying expert; but same rule logically should apply to withdrawing nonparty experts who have a privileged relationship with party (e.g., party’s doctor or lawyer); see also ¶ 8:216]If the expert has been deposed, the other party may still call that expert at trial. [CCP § 2034.310(a)]➪ [8:1687.6] PRACTICE POINTER: Of course, withdrawing a designated expert alerts your adversary to the problem. Opposing counsel is likely to try to hire the expert to give testimony against you, although there may be ethical issues that could lead to disqualification (see ¶ 1:89.5 ff.).You can avoid this problem by retaining the expert in a consultant capacity for the balance of the litigation. That way, the consultant’s reports remain protected as work product (see ¶ 8:246); and opposing counsel can neither communicate with your consultant, nor depose the consultant, nor designate the consultant as the opposing side’s expert. [See Kennedy v. Sup.Ct. (Lucky Stores, Inc.) (1998) 64 CA4th 674, 679, 75 CR2d 373, 375—party may “hide” expert from deposition by withdrawing expert and dubbing expert a “consultant,” thereby reinstating work product protection](1) [8:1687.6a] Exception for agreement to suppress? When two adverse parties agree that one will withdraw an expert and the expert’s report in return for indemnity against liability, the agreement may be void as against public policy. [County of Los Angeles v. Sup.Ct. (Hernandez), supra, 222 CA3d at 656, 271 CR at 703 (citing Williamson v. Sup.Ct. (Shell Oil Co.)

[CCP § 2034.410] If the expert is one who has been retained to testify (see ¶ 8:1668), it is the responsibility of the party designating that expert to make the expert available for deposition upon service of a proper deposition notice and payment of the expert’s fees by the deposing party. [CCP §§ 2034.410, 2034.460(a); see ¶ 8:1695] If too many experts are designated by any party, an opposing party may promptly seek a protective order to reduce the list of opposing experts. [CCP § 2034.250(b)(6)] Regular deposition rules and procedures apply to the deposition of such experts, except as stated below (¶ 8:1690 ff.). [CCP § 2034.410] ➪ [8:1689] PRACTICE POINTERS RE DEPOSING OPPOSING EXPERTS: Once the identity of opposing experts is ascertained, you have to decide whether to take their depositions. This decision often has to be made “under the gun” because of the time pressures noted below (¶ 8:1690). Here are the factors to consider:• The costs involved in depositions generally; and the special costs in deposing an opposing expert (expert witness fees, see ¶ 8:1697 ff.);• Whether reports of the expert’s expected testimony have been provided (or can be obtained from opposing counsel);• Whether such reports provide enough information to gauge what the expert is likely to say on the witness stand;• How important or controversial the expert testimony is likely to be;• How strong or weak a witness the expert is likely to be (reputation);• The advantages vs. disadvantages of depositions generally.In deposing an opposing expert, be sure to elicit each and every opinion the expert has regarding the subject and the reasons supporting them. Often, the best question to ask is “Why?” (Although dangerous in cross-examining a witness at trial, “Why?” is an excellent question in deposing an expert because it exposes the opponent’s theory of the case, and how well this expert can present it.) [See Burton v. Cruise (2010) 190 CA4th 939, 951, 118 CR3d 613, 622 (citing text)]At the same time, try not to “give away” your planned avenues of attack on the expert’s opinion, particularly if deficiencies in the expert’s testimony can be cured before trial. The time to “destroy” an opposing expert is at trial, not at deposition.To avoid unpleasant surprises at trial, be sure to ask an opposing expert the following:• What exhibits will you use at trial?• What assignment were you given? Have you completed that assignment?— If not, is it possible that the part you have not completed will change the exhibits you plan to use or the opinions you plan to express at trial? (If so, when can we continue your deposition?)• What are the areas in which you will be offering an opinion at trial?• Are there any other areas relevant to this case in which you are prepared to express an opinion if asked?• What is the basis for your opinion regarding …?• What documents, reference materials, conversations, meetings or examinations support that opinion?• What part of your education or experience qualifies you to offer that opinion?• Ask treating physicians whether they hold any opinions on the matter on which expert testimony will be required at trial; and if so, the manner in which they obtained the factual underpinning of those opinions. [See Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser (1999) 22 C4th 31, 39, 91 CR2d 293, 300] (Note, however, that this question may obligate deposing counsel to pay an expert witness fee to the treating physician; see ¶ 8:1697.5.)• After this deposition, do you have any plans to review more evidence, conduct more experiments or do anything else to support your opinions? (See ¶ 8:1718.2.)• Do you have any opinions about any of the other experts or expert opinions in this case?• If you had limitless time and resources, is there other work you would like to do in forming your opinions?• (In conclusion) Do you have any opinions for trial that I have not asked you about? a. [8:1690] Time limits; discovery “cut-off” before trial: Depositions of experts identified pursuant to CCP § 2034.260 may be taken as late as 15 days before trial—instead of the 30-day “cut-off” applicable to other depositions and discovery. [CCP § 2024.030]And, motions to enforce discovery relating to such depositions may be heard until 10 days before trial (instead of the 15-day cut-off on other discovery motions). [CCP § 2024.030][8:1690.1] Exception—experts on supplemental list: Experts designated on a “supplemental expert witness list” (covering topics designated by another party; see ¶ 8:1686) can be deposed even after the 15-day cut-off discussed above (¶ 8:1690). [CCP § 2034.280(c)](1) [8:1691] Effect: You have only a limited time within which to depose opposing experts and follow up with whatever discovery motions are required. Your opponent’s list will usually not be received until 50 days before trial (see ¶ 8:1660); and any motion to compel must be heard not later than 10 days before trial. So, you have only 40 days within which to schedule and take depositions of opposing experts, and to follow up with a motion to compel answers if necessary. [See St. Mary Med. Ctr. v. Sup.Ct. (Mennella) (1996) 50 CA4th 1531, 1538, 58 CR2d 182, 186](2) [8:1692] Waiver of discovery “cut-off”? It may be possible to relieve the time pressure somewhat by stipulating with opposing counsel to waive the CCP § 2024.030 “cut-off” dates, which would allow depositions to be taken right up until the trial date. [See CCP § 2016.030]➪ [8:1693] PRACTICE POINTER: This is a dangerous thing to do. Extending depositions into the days and weeks before trial of a major lawsuit will undoubtedly interfere with trial preparations.Rather than waive these “cut-offs,” try to obtain stipulations with opposing counsel on a schedule for depositions which, if necessary, extends beyond the cut-off date and may involve less than 10 days’ notice. Also consider agreeing to expert disclosure and discovery earlier than set by applicable law.(3) [8:1693.1] Compare—deposing experts for summary judgment motions: The time limits for completing expert witness depositions are even more of a problem where expert opinion testimony is utilized in connection with a summary judgment motion. (That motion can be made up to 30 days before trial; CCP § 437c(a), see ¶ 10:71.)Further complicating matters is the 81-day notice of motion requirement for summary judgment and adjudication motions, which may not be shortened. [CCP § 437c(a) (amended eff. 1/1/25); see ¶ 10:77 ff.]If the expert witness exchange does not take place until 50 days before trial, this leaves no time to depose opposing experts before noticing a summary judgment motion. [See St. Mary Med. Ctr. v. Sup.Ct. (Mennella), supra, 50 CA4th at 1538, 58 CR2d at 186]For this reason, although there is no statutory right to the relief, a court may permit earlier depositions of expert witnesses whose opinions are filed in support of or in opposition to a motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication. [St. Mary Med. Ctr. v. Sup.Ct. (Mennella), supra, 50 CA4th at 1539, 58 CR2d at 186; see Perry v. Bakewell Hawthorne, LLC (2017) 2 C5th 536, 538, 213 CR3d 764, 765—undisclosed expert’s opinion inadmissible for summary judgment motion heard after disclosure date absent relief from failure to disclose requirement; ¶ 8:1719.5] b. [8:1694] Geographic limits: The deposition of an expert retained or employed by a party must be taken within 75 miles of the courthouse where the action is pending. (On a showing of “exceptional hardship,” the court may allow a deposition beyond this limit.) [CCP § 2034.420](1) [8:1694.1] Compare—“independent” experts: Depositions of “independent” experts (not retained or employed by any party) can be taken only pursuant to deposition subpoena—i.e., these experts have to be deposed within 75 miles of their residence (150 miles, if deposed within the county where the action is pending). [CCP § 2025.250(a); see ¶ 8:622]This applies to a treating physician who has not been designated as an expert witness. c. [8:1695] No subpoena necessary for retained experts: If the expert has been retained to testify (“retained by a party for the purpose of forming and expressing an opinion”), no subpoena is necessary. Service of a proper deposition notice, accompanied by an expert witness fee (see ¶ 8:1697), obligates the party designating such expert to produce the expert for deposition. [CCP § 2034.460(a)](1) [8:1695.1] Subpoena necessary for expert-related documents in possession of persons other than expert? A notice to depose the retained expert may be coupled with a demand the expert produce documents no later than three business days before the deposition (CCP § 2034.415). If there has been no demand for discoverable writings, or no compliance with such a demand under CCP §§ 2034.270 and 2034.210, and if the items may be in the possession of a party or counsel (as opposed to the expert), then a subpoena may be necessary. CCP § 2034.410 states the deposition of a listed trial expert shall be governed by § 2025.010 et seq. deposition procedures; and § 2025.280(b) requires a deposition subpoena for production of a nonparty deponent’s records (see ¶ 8:535 ff.).➪ [8:1695.2] PRACTICE POINTER: Until this issue is clarified, serve a deposition subpoena to obtain the expert’s documents, regardless of who has them, unless the party who retained the expert agrees to make them available.(2) [8:1696] Compare—“independent” experts: “Independent” experts (not retained or employed by any party) must be subpoenaed. This will require payment of a witness fee and mileage (see CCP § 2020.230(a), ¶ 8:572). In addition, an expert witness fee may have to be paid; see ¶ 8:1697 ff.(3) [8:1696.1] Compare—treating physicians: Treating physicians are regarded as percipient witnesses (not “retained for the purpose” of giving expert testimony). Thus, the party designating treating physicians on an expert witness list is not obligated to produce them for depositions. I.e., they must be subpoenaed by the deposing party; and an expert witness fee may be payable (see ¶ 8:1697.4 ff.). [Hurtado v. Western Med. Ctr. (1990) 222 CA3d 1198, 1203, 272 CR 324, 327] d. [8:1697] Payment of expert’s fees: Certain experts are entitled to be paid “reasonable and customary” fees for their time spent in the deposition, as described below (¶ 8:1703 ff.). [CCP § 2034.430(b)] (Similar rules apply where experts are subpoenaed to appear at trial; see Gov.C. § 68092.5.)(1) [8:1697.1] Who must pay: The deposing party alone is responsible for payment of the expert’s fee. [CCP § 2034.430(b)](a) [8:1697.2] Effect of other parties prolonging deposition: This is true even when other parties engage in prolonged cross-examination, unreasonably extending the deposition (see ¶ 8:1706). The Discovery Act does not empower the court to order other parties to contribute to the expert’s fees.(Compare—deposition reporter costs: Courts do have power, for “good cause” shown, to order other parties to share the costs of the deposition transcript; CCP § 2025.510(b), ¶ 8:767.1.)➪ [8:1697.3] PRACTICE POINTER: If you are the deposing party in such a situation, ask garrulous cross-examiners (on the record) to assume responsibility for a portion of the expert’s fees. If they refuse, adjourn the deposition pursuant to CCP § 2025.470 and seek a protective order against further questioning by them.(2) [8:1697.4] Which experts entitled to fees: Such fees are payable to any expert witness listed in the exchange other than parties or employees of parties. [CCP § 2034.430(a)](a) [8:1697.5] Treating physicians if asked to express expert opinion: Thus, expert witness fees must be paid to depose a treating physician (or other health care practitioner) who is to be asked to express an opinion during the deposition. This includes questions asking for opinions or facts regarding the patient’s past or present diagnosis or future prognosis, or the reasons for a particular treatment decision. [CCP § 2034.430(a)(2)]But no expert fee need be paid if the doctor is asked only to read “words and symbols contained in the relevant medical record” (or if they are illegible to the deponent, to ask for an approximation of what they are). [See CCP § 2034.430(a)(2)]➪ [8:1697.6] PRACTICE POINTER: A deposing party may still be able to obtain opinions without paying an expert witness fee by sticking to entries in the doctor’s records. E.g., “Doctor, did you make an entry in your records regarding your diagnosis of this patient?” “Where is that entry?” “What does it say?”But this is not recommended where serious injuries are involved. The deposing attorney needs much more information regarding the treating physician’s opinions than can be obtained by having the witness read medical records. The deposing attorney better plan on paying a fee to the treating physician.(b) [8:1697.6a] Architects, engineers and surveyors: An expert witness fee must also be paid to “[a]n architect, professional engineer, or licensed land surveyor who was involved with the original project design or survey for which that person is asked to express an opinion.” [CCP § 2034.430(a)(3); Gov.C. § 68092.5](c) [8:1697.7] Not “employees”: An expert witness fee need not be paid to an expert who is either a party or an “employee” of the party who designated the expert. [CCP § 2034.430(a) (emphasis added)](Comment: “Employee” is not defined, but presumably it covers either full or part-time employment. “Employed” experts are distinguished from those “retained” by a party on a case-by-case basis to render an opinion; see CCP § 2034.210(b).)(3) [8:1698] When payable: The expert witness fee may be tendered either on service of the deposition notice or at commencement of the expert’s deposition. (In either case, the fee is delivered to the attorney for the party designating the expert.) [CCP § 2034.450(a), (b)](a) [8:1699] Effect of failure to pay: If the expert’s fee has not been paid by the time of the deposition, “the expert shall not be deposed at that time unless the parties stipulate otherwise.” [CCP § 2034.460(b)]Nor can sanctions be imposed against the party designating the expert based on the expert’s refusal to appear or testify. [See Tahoe Forest Inn v. Sup.Ct. (Turney) (1979) 99 CA3d 509, 513, 160 CR 314, 316 (decided under former law)](4) [8:1700] How much: The deposing party must estimate how long the deposition will take, and must tender enough to pay the expert’s hourly or daily rate (as stated in the expert witness declaration; see ¶ 8:1668.4) for that length of time. [CCP § 2034.450(a)](a) [8:1701] “Anticipated length of deposition”: The fee to be tendered by the deposing party must be sufficient for the entire deposition, not merely the estimated time it will take deposing counsel to examine the expert. I.e., the fee must include the estimated time for reasonable cross-examination by other parties attending the deposition.➪ [8:1701.1] PRACTICE POINTER: The remedy for controlling garrulous cross-examiners is discussed at ¶ 8:1697.3.(b) [8:1702] NOT preparation or travel time: However, the expert is not entitled to fees for time spent in preparing for the deposition or for travel expenses. Any such fees or expenses are the responsibility of the party designating the expert. [CCP § 2034.440](c) [8:1703] “Reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee”: The expert’s “reasonable and customary” fee is the amount disclosed in the “expert witness declaration” provided in the expert witness exchange (see ¶ 8:1668).1) [8:1703.1] Variable rates permitted: It is not unreasonable for an expert to charge more for deposition testimony and court appearances than for ordinary services and consultation: “The process of giving formal testimony under oath … is an obviously more stressful and tense activity than consulting with your client in his office.” [Rancho Bernardo Develop. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Oaks North Villas Condominium Ass’n) (1992) 2 CA4th 358, 362, 2 CR2d 878, 880]2) [8:1703.2] Includes waiting time: The fee to be paid must include all time spent by the expert witness at the deposition, from the time noticed in the deposition subpoena (or the time of the witness’ arrival, if later) until the time the expert witness is dismissed. It is immaterial whether the deposition commences on time or whether the expert is even deposed. [CCP § 2034.430(b)]a) [8:1703.3] Counsel responsible for delay must pay: Where a deposition is delayed because an attorney representing the expert or a non-noticing party is late, that attorney must pay the expert’s reasonable and customary hourly or daily fee for the period of the delay (from the time noticed in the deposition subpoena until the counsel’s late arrival). [CCP § 2034.430(c)][8:1703.4] Reserved.3) [8:1703.5] Limitation: Such witness cannot charge more than the rate charged the party who retained the expert (except where the witness’ services were donated to a charitable or other nonprofit organization). [CCP § 2034.430(d); Gov.C. § 68092.5] (Effect: If the party retaining the expert is getting a “wholesale rate” for the expert’s time, the deposing party also benefits.)4) [8:1703.6] Limitation on charging daily fee: An expert may not charge a daily fee unless required to attend a deposition for a full day, or unless the deposing party required the expert to be available for a full day and the expert necessarily had to forgo all business the expert would have otherwise conducted that day. [CCP § 2034.430(e)](d) [8:1704] If amount demanded deemed excessive: If the deposing party deems the expert’s fee to be unreasonable (e.g., the expert insists on charging a full day’s rate for a deposition lasting less than an hour), the deposing party may move for an order setting the compensation of that expert. [CCP § 2034.470(a)]➪ [8:1704a] PRACTICE POINTER: There is no time limit on this motion and, therefore, it apparently can be made either before or after the deposition. But it may be better practice to wait until after the deposition. Doing so beforehand will simply ensure a hostile witness.If you intend to file such a motion, avoid making any statement that could be construed as a promise to pay the requested fees. Otherwise, the court may hold you are estopped from later seeking a reduction.In any event, the court’s power is to set a “reasonable” fee for the expert’s testimony. Therefore, if you’re objecting to the fee charged, be prepared with evidence of deposition rates charged by experts with similar qualifications. (Your own declaration may suffice if you have had sufficient experience employing expert witnesses; otherwise, get declarations from qualified experts.)1) [8:1704.1] Attempt at informal resolution required: As with most other discovery motions, it must be accompanied by a declaration showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve the matter outside court. And if the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), the court “shall” impose a monetary sanction against the losing party unless it finds “substantial justification” for that party’s position or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2034.470(b), (g)]In any such attempt, the expert or party designating the expert shall provide the other with:— proof of the ordinary and customary fee actually charged and received by that expert for similar services provided outside the subject litigation;— the number of times the expert has ever charged and received the presently demanded fee; and— the frequency and regularity with which the presently demanded fee has been charged and received by that expert within the two-year period preceding the hearing on the motion. [CCP § 2034.470(b)]2) [8:1704.2] Proof required on motion: In addition to any other evidence, the expert or party designating the expert must provide the court with the information listed in the preceding paragraph. [CCP § 2034.470(d)]3) [8:1704.3] Court’s determination: The court’s determination of the “reasonable” fee to be paid by the deposing party may be based on the foregoing proof. The court may also consider the ordinary and customary fees charged by similar experts for similar services within the relevant community “and any other factors the court deems necessary or appropriate to make its determination.” [CCP § 2034.470(e)]The factors considered as well as the amount deemed “reasonable” are within the trial court’s sound discretion. [Marsh v. Mountain Zephyr, Inc. (1996) 43 CA4th 289, 303, 50 CR2d 493, 502]a) [8:1704.4] Not bound by “customary” fee: The court is not bound to award the expert’s “customary” fee for deposition testimony. It is merely one factor considered in determining the “reasonable” fee the deposing party must pay for deposing another party’s expert. [Marsh v. Mountain Zephyr, Inc., supra, 43 CA4th at 304, 50 CR2d at 503—architect’s “customary” fee was $360 per hour; court set $250 as “reasonable” fee]b) [8:1704.5] Client’s responsibility for excess: Any fee charged by the expert in excess of what the court finds “reasonable” remains a matter of negotiation and agreement between the expert and the party designating the expert. The party deposing the expert is responsible for only the “reasonable” fee set by the court. [Marsh v. Mountain Zephyr, Inc. (1996) 43 CA4th 289, 300-301, 50 CR2d 493, 500]➪ [8:1704.6] PRACTICE POINTER: If your expert demands a greater fee than the deposing party has tendered, your client should be prepared to pay the excess.[8:1705] Reserved.(e) [8:1706] If amount tendered insufficient: If the expert’s deposition takes longer than anticipated, the deposing party must pay the balance of the expert’s fee within 5 days after receipt of an itemized statement from the expert. [CCP § 2034.450(c)]1) [8:1707] Comment: Thus, other parties, by prolonged questioning, can run up the cost to the deposing party.

Daley (2002) 96 CA4th 479, 484, 116 CR2d 882, 886] a. [8:1732] Motion for belated submission (TARDY lists): A party who failed to exchange under CCP § 2034.260 on time (normally 50 days before trial) may seek leave to submit the required material on a later date. [CCP § 2034.710][8:1733] Reserved.(1) [8:1734] Deadline for motion: Absent “exceptional circumstances,” the motion for permission to file a tardy list must be made early enough to permit deposing the experts involved before the 15-day cut-off on expert witness depositions. [CCP §§ 2034.710(b), 2024.030](a) [8:1735] Effect: This leaves a very narrow time window for relief. I.e., a party missing the exchange deadline 50 days before trial must serve a motion for relief, and have it heard and granted in time for depositions to be completed 15 days before trial. Orders shortening time for hearing on the motion and for notice of deposition are likely to be required.(b) [8:1736] “Exceptional circumstances” for later motion: The statute allows the motion to be granted later, even during trial, on a showing of “exceptional circumstances” and on such “terms as may be just.” [See Plunkett v. Spaulding (1997) 52 CA4th 114, 137, 60 CR2d 377, 390-391 (citing text) (disapproved on other grounds by Schreiber v. Estate of Kiser (1999) 22 C4th 31, 91 CR2d 293); Cottini v. Enloe Med. Ctr. (2014) 226 CA4th 401, 420-421, 172 CR3d 4, 19](Arguably, relief might be proper if the moving party believed honestly and in good faith that its expert witness information had been timely exchanged, but it was lost in the mail or never received.)(2) [8:1737] Showing required for relief: The court may permit tardy submission of expert witness lists and information if the following matters are shown [CCP § 2034.720]:(a) [8:1737.1] Excuse: The moving party’s failure to exchange expert witness information on time resulted from “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” [CCP § 2034.720(c)(1); see Cottini v. Enloe Med. Ctr., supra, 226 CA4th at 421-422, 172 CR3d at 20—no relief where failure due to “gamesmanship” rather than § 2034.720(c)(1) grounds]1) [8:1737.1a] Mistake of law: An honest mistake of law may be a valid excuse. [See Plunkett v. Spaulding (1997) 52 CA4th 114, 137, 60 CR2d 377, 391—moving party’s counsel mistakenly believed expert witness declaration was not required for treating physicians who were expected to give standard of care testimony; mistake not unreasonable because issue was one of first impression](b) [8:1737.2] Relief sought promptly: The motion for relief is being made promptly after learning of such excuse;(c) [8:1737.3] Information belatedly served on all other parties: The moving party has already served a copy of the proposed expert witness list and declarations on all other parties to the action;(d) [8:1737.4] Availability for deposition: The moving party will make the witness available immediately for a deposition if leave is granted;(e) [8:1737.5] No prejudice to opposing party: The court must “take into account” the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the absence of an expert witness list from the moving party. Before granting leave to submit the tardy list, the court must determine that it will not prejudice the opposing party’s ability to maintain its action or defense on the merits; and(f) [8:1737.6] Attempt to resolve informally: The usual declarations are required stating a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally each issue presented by the motion. [CCP § 2034.710(c)](3) [8:1738] Order: In ruling on the motion, the court must consider all of the § 2034.720 factors enumerated above (¶ 8:1737 ff.). [Plunkett v. Spaulding, supra, 52 CA4th at 135-136, 60 CR2d at 390—denial based solely on timing of motion an abuse of discretion]If relief is granted, it must be conditioned on the moving party making the expert available for deposition “immediately.” [CCP § 2034.720(d)]The court may also impose such other terms as may be just, including:• Allowing opposing parties to designate additional experts or to elicit additional opinions from previously designated experts; or• Ordering a continuance of the trial and award of costs and litigation expenses to opposing parties;• Ordering the moving party to pay for any additional cost to obtain an expedited deposition transcript;• Awarding costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion. [CCP § 2034.720(d)](4) [8:1738.1] Sanctions: If the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), a monetary sanction “shall” be imposed against the losing party unless the court finds “substantial justification” for that party’s position or other circumstances make the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2034.730; see ¶ 8:1921 ff.] b. [8:1739] Motion to augment or amend (DIFFERENT experts or topics): A party may discover the need for additional expert testimony after having exchanged expert witness information.If the additional testimony is on subjects raised in an opponent’s expert witness information, the party has the right to serve a “supplemental expert witness list” within 20 days. [See CCP § 2034.280, ¶ 8:1686 ff.]Where, however, the additional testimony relates to subjects disclosed in the party’s original exchange, the party must seek leave of court to augment or amend the earlier information, either by:• Adding subsequently retained experts to the expert witness list; or• Amending the expert witness declaration to expand the “general substance” of the testimony which any previously designated expert will give. [CCP § 2034.610; see Richaud v. Jennings (1993) 16 CA4th 81, 91, 19 CR2d 790, 796—“supplemental designation” filed without leave of court held ineffective][8:1740] Comment: Absent leave to amend, objections will likely be sustained to an expert testifying beyond the substance of that disclosed in the expert witness declaration (see ¶ 8:1717.1), unless the opposing party had adequate notice that the expert would offer new testimony. [See Easterby v. Clark (2009) 171 CA4th 772, 781, 90 CR3d 81, 89—P’s expert allowed to testify on topic not included in expert designation because D had adequate notice and opportunity to depose P’s expert in advance of trial; Valencia v. Mendoza (2024) 103 CA5th 427, 449, 322 CR3d 903, 920—where supplemental discovery response stated that expert would review other experts’ depo testimony to assess their opinions but refused to make expert available to be deposed on additional opinions, expert testimony was properly excluded](1) [8:1741] Deadline for motion: Absent “exceptional circumstances,” this motion must be made early enough to permit deposing the experts involved before the 15-day “cut-off” on deposing experts. [See CCP §§ 2034.610(b), 2024.030](a) [8:1741.1] Effect: This again leaves a very narrow time window for relief. A party who has exchanged information 50 days before trial is not likely to realize the need for more experts and be able to file a motion, have it heard and complete depositions 15 days before trial. Again, orders shortening time on the motion and notice of deposition are likely to be required.(b) [8:1741.2] “Exceptional circumstances” for later motion: The statute requires a showing of “exceptional circumstances” for the motion to be heard later.The fact an augmentation motion is delayed until trial does not bar relief. Even at that late date, the motion would allow the proponent to show good cause for the delay, allow the opponent to explain the prejudice created, “and, most importantly, allow the court to minimize any continuances and disruption of the litigation.” [Richaud v. Jennings (1993) 16 CA4th 81, 92, 19 CR2d 790, 796]1) [8:1742] Comment: As a practical matter, the need to augment or amend expert witness lists and information usually arises during trial when shifts in the evidence disclose a sudden need for new, unlisted experts, or testimony from listed experts goes beyond the topics disclosed in their expert witness declarations.(c) [8:1743] Limitations: There are some practical limitations, however: i.e., the undisclosed expert must be made available for deposition “immediately” (see ¶ 8:1744 ff.). And the later relief is sought, the less likely it will be granted.(2) [8:1744] Showing required: To obtain permission to augment or amend the expert witness information previously furnished, the moving party must convince the court as to the following matters [CCP § 2034.620]:(a) [8:1744.1] Excuse: First of all, it must be shown that the moving party either:— could not have been expected in the exercise of reasonable diligence to call that expert or offer the additional testimony at the time of the original exchange; or— failed to include the expert or the additional testimony through “mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.” [CCP § 2034.620(c) (emphasis added)]For example:• [8:1744.1a] The expert originally designated by D gave deposition testimony damaging to D. This was sufficient “surprise” to permit D to augment his expert witness list. [Dickison v. Howen (1990) 220 CA3d 1471, 1478, 270 CR 188, 192]• [8:1744.1b] P timely designates an expert who dies before trial. A motion to augment the expert witness list to include a replacement is appropriate. P could not have been expected to know that a replacement would be required at the time of the original designation. [Richaud v. Jennings (1993) 16 CA4th 81, 90, 19 CR2d 790, 795](b) [8:1744.2] Relief sought promptly: Leave to augment or amend is being sought promptly after deciding to call the expert or offer the additional testimony. [CCP § 2034.620(c)(2)(A)](c) [8:1744.3] Information served on all other parties: The moving party has now served on all other parties to the action a copy of the proposed expert witness information pertaining to such expert or testimony. [CCP § 2034.620(c)(2)(B)](d) [8:1744.4] Availability for deposition: The moving party will make the witness available immediately for a deposition if leave is granted. [CCP § 2034.620(d)](e) [8:1744.5] No prejudice to opposing party: The court must “take into account” the extent to which the opposing party has relied on the expert list furnished by the moving party. Leave to augment or amend may be granted only if the court determines it will not prejudice the opposing party’s ability to maintain its action or defense on the merits. [CCP § 2034.620(a), (b)]1) [8:1744.5a] The opposing party is not “prejudiced” simply because the new expert will give testimony adverse to that party. Rather, the focus should be on the opposing party’s ability to respond to the new testimony. [Dickison v. Howen, supra, 220 CA3d at 1479-1480, 270 CR at 193]➪ [8:1744.5b] PRACTICE POINTER: To deflate the other side’s claims of “prejudice,” the party seeking to augment should consider offering to stipulate to the following conditions:— no more than one new expert;— the new expert is to be made available for deposition immediately at the office of opposing counsel;— all deposition expenses are to be paid by the party seeking to augment; and— opposing counsel is to be given a list of all cases in which the new expert has consulted or given expert testimony during the past 3 years, together with an itemization of fees paid and the names of opposing counsel in those cases. [See Dickison v. Howen, supra, 220 CA3d at 1480, 270 CR at 193](f) [8:1744.6] Attempt to resolve informally: Finally, with discovery motions generally, factual declarations are required showing a “reasonable and good faith attempt” to resolve informally each issue raised by the motion. [CCP §§ 2016.040, 2034.610(c)](3) [8:1745] Factors affecting court’s decision: Granting or denial of relief in these cases lies within the court’s sound discretion, and is subject to appellate review only for abuse of discretion. [See Bonds v. Roy (1999) 20 C4th 140, 149, 83 CR2d 289, 294]The court is likely to focus on the following factors:(a) [8:1746] Disruption of trial? Undisclosed experts may be permitted to testify where the moving party was reasonably diligent in seeking relief and no prejudice to the opposing party is shown, if allowing such testimony will not unreasonably complicate or disrupt the trial.As observed by one court: “[W]e can only assume the motion would have been granted since it involved only one witness and a limited subject matter. The [expert’s] deposition could have been taken after court hours, thereby avoiding any disruption of the trial proceedings.” [Kennemur v. State of Calif. (1982) 133 CA3d 907, 920, 184 CR 393, 400](b) [8:1747] “Game playing”? But relief will not likely be granted where the party seeking relief made a deliberate, tactical decision not to disclose the expert earlier (e.g., keeping an expert “in the closet” until after opposing experts have testified, in an effort to “sandbag” the opposing party). [See Kennemur v. State of Calif., supra, 133 CA3d at 920, 184 CR at 400-401; Sprague v. Equifax, Inc. (1985) 166 CA3d 1012, 1039-1040, 213 CR 69, 87][8:1747.1 - 8:1747.4] Reserved.(c) [8:1747.5] No excuse for delay: Leave to amend an expert witness declaration was properly denied on the last day of testimony because there was no practical opportunity to depose the expert or to provide rebuttal testimony, and counsel had offered no excuse for failure to seek leave earlier. [Bonds v. Roy (1999) 20 C4th 140, 149, 83 CR2d 289, 294—expert’s testimony properly limited to general substance of that described in expert witness declaration](d) [8:1748] Risk of new trial? Allowing an undisclosed expert to testify (or a disclosed expert to testify on matters not disclosed in the “expert witness declaration”) creates a risk that a new trial may be granted on ground of “surprise”: i.e., the opposing party may have a strong claim that it was deprived of adequate opportunity to prepare for or rebut the “surprise” expert testimony. [See City of Fresno v. Harrison (1984) 154 CA3d 296, 300-301, 201 CR 219, 221](4) [8:1749] Order: If relief is granted, it must be conditioned on the moving party making the expert available for deposition “immediately” and such other terms as the court deems “just.” [CCP § 2034.620(d)](a) [8:1750] Conditioned on “immediate” availability for deposition: The effect of this requirement is that the later relief is requested, the less likely it will be granted, particularly if trial has already commenced.1) [8:1751] Practical considerations: Depositions can be taken even during trial (e.g., the court may grant a continuance or order the depositions taken after hours). [See Kennemur v. State of Calif., supra, 133 CA3d at 920, 184 CR at 400]But given the technical nature of expert testimony, the judge may decide that a few hours or a few days is not enough time to prepare for cross-examination of an undisclosed expert, and therefore might refuse to allow that expert to testify. [See Gallo v. Peninsula Hosp. (1985) 164 CA3d 899, 905, 211 CR 27, 31]• [8:1751.1] Where the error in complying with CCP § 2034.010 is a correctable minor infraction, the trial court may be obliged to allow the expert to be deposed during trial rather than excluding the expert’s testimony. [See Fatica v. Sup.Ct. (Liljegren) (2002) 99 CA4th 350, 353, 120 CR2d 904, 906—error to exclude opinion testimony of treating physician who inadvertently neglected to review medical records prior to deposition; he should have been ordered to submit to deposition during trial]2) [8:1752] Deposing party must still pay expert’s fee: The moving party’s obligation to make the expert “available” for deposition does not change the statutory requirement that the deposing party pay the expert’s “reasonable and customary fee” for deposition testimony (CCP § 2034.430(b); ¶ 8:1697 ff.). [See Tahoe Forest Inn v. Sup.Ct. (Turney) (1979) 99 CA3d 509, 513, 160 CR 314, 316 (decided under former § 2034(i)(2))](b) [8:1753] Other terms and conditions: The order granting relief may also be conditioned on other terms the court finds “just,” including:• Allowing opposing parties to designate additional experts or their previously designated experts to give opinions on additional subjects;• Ordering a continuance of trial and an award of costs and litigation expenses to opposing parties; or• Awarding costs and litigation expenses to any party opposing the motion. [CCP § 2034.620(d)](5) [8:1754] Sanctions: As with discovery motions generally, if the party properly asks for monetary sanctions (see ¶ 8:1980 ff.), a monetary sanction “shall” be imposed against the losing party on a motion to augment or amend expert witness information unless the court finds “substantial justification” for that party’s position or other circumstances make imposition of the sanction “unjust.” [CCP § 2034.630][8:1755 - 8:1756] Reserved. © 2025 by The Rutter Group, a Thomson Reuters Business.
